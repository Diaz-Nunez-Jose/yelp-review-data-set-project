While the selection is a little small, the quality seems high.  The warmed scone I had was easily one of the better biscuits I've had, with just the right amount of butter and raspberry jam.\r\n\r\nTheir cooler of bottled water and soft drinks seems to be very convenient for those strolling through Old Town.\r\n\r\nService was fine, especially considering how very busy they were.  It was a bit of a pain to have to ask what was in everything as there were no tiny signs with ingredients\\/descriptions that I saw.  The sausage rolls here are amazing and a great value.  I cant wait to eat through the pie menu.  So far ive had the meat and curry chicken, flaky buttery crust and very tasty inside.  A great addition to old town Scottsdale.  This cafe\\/ bakery is an amazing place. My wife and I were visiting from California and found this local gem. The women behind the counter were so nice and the drinks and "pasties" were delicious! Highly recommend this placed!  Family visited Scottsdale this past weekend. Stopped for a quick snack, great tasting pies, awesome desserts. Super friendly staff. A must if you're in the area.  Wow, the chicken artichoke pot pie was unexpectedly delicious - hot, flaky, savory!!! We loved it. We were not sure what to expect so we picked 1 "safe" item - bacon quiche pie. It was also very tasty and super satisfying. But, I wish we would have picked one of the more unique flavors. I could see coming back everytime we visit the area. Great friendly service too. Loved it!  Was fantastic, had the chicken avocado pie and the sausage roll.  Service was good too, friendly staff. Flavor was amazing, will definitely come back for some Bundaberg rum when they get the bar put in.  Having grown up in Australia, one of the things I miss most about home is the small town Aussie bakery.  Every town main street and suburban shopping mall has a bakery that in addition to bread, sells delicious savory pies, pasties and sausage rolls, and sweet treats like lamingtons, custard tarts and matchsticks.  Great Australian Bakery in Scottsdale has captured the spirit of these places and landed them in my new backyard in Arizona.  An exciting find! In addition to the traditional bakery counter, they also combine another iconic Aussie landmark - the local "pub" (public bar).  The bakery has a really nice bar space serving a full range of drinks including an Aussie style bitter on tap (apparently brewed at a local microbrewery just around the corner).  If you think you might like a real taste of Australian cuisine and friendly culture, you should give this place a try.  It possibly is the best coffee in scottsdale.  The spinach feta quiche and apple turn over are amazing.  My daughters iced caramel latte was very good.  Highly recommended.  Not a friendly and warm place. Looks more like a prison bakery with some scattered seating for the guests\\/inmates. Was hoping for a "G\'Day mate" greeting, but after standing at the counter for several minutes, nobody yelled "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie" or even gave us a normal hello. The girl and guy working both turned their backs and said nothing. I doubt we missed anything special as they stuff some greasy meats inside flaky Pillsbury Dough. The whole country really eats these things everyday? The goal was too actually get a desert, but those did not look tasty either. Hey, I used to like Foster\'s beer back in the 90\'s, so don\'t feel too bad Australia.  This place is a must-do in Scottsdale! We are locals from Tempe and came to try their food and pasties. Our expectations were surpassed with a delicious sausage roll, chicken avocado pie, and others! The Lamington dessert and apple turnover were perfectly made and I ate the rest of it! \r\n\r\nThe owner is so cordial and the staff was just as good. The owner came over to our table and put a small town home feel. We will definitely be coming back!  Delicious meat pies. Great service and the coffee is good too! Highly recommend for a quick bite and coffee if you don't want to wait in the insane line at Dutch bros or Starbucks!  Yummy and different, that's what I'll start my review with. Went in yesterday with my husband after we finished an appointment in the area. Found them on Yelp, very good reviews and walking distance almost from we were so why not. \r\n\r\nWhen we went in, I was surprised at how the place looked, cafeteria style look, something's being built (or fixed) in the lobby where they're at so the first impression was, hmmm I hope this will be good! \r\n\r\nYou order at the cashier. Everything is pretty much on display so you can pick what you want and I'll be served immediately. Great if you're in a hurry. \r\n\r\nMy husband and I both ordered the spinach and feta cheese rolls and got 1 Rosemary chicken pie. Both are served with dipping sauces. We also ordered two coffees, small. Order came out to about $20+ not a bad deal! \r\n\r\nWe dug in and it was great. I particularly loved the Rosemary Chicken with it's dipping sauce. the sauce was had a lemony flavor, something that really went well with the chicken pie. \r\n\r\nAfter we finished, I was craving dessert so I decided to try something there too. I had.. Umm.. Can't remember what it's called but it's basically a sponge cake dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut, OMG yes I wanna try that. I had it and to me and to the ppl who know Bounty Chocolate, this was a Bounty Cake! I liked it. It was moist and tasted very good, thanks to the guy who took our orders! It was his suggestion as well as the Rosemary chicken. \r\n\r\nGreat service, extra clean bathrooms, very good food! I'm going there again to try the rest of their pies! Yes, I love savory pies! \r\n\r\nNote: I didn't have time to take pics. The food had to be eaten immediately, sorry! :p  The almost identical twin of the Cornish Pasty that is pleasing palates on the other side of Old Town.  The rolls and tarts add a distinctive Australian twist to the concept.  The Great Australian Bakery is located in Old Town Scottsdale. They offer savory and sweet Australian baked goods. This is a casual order at the counter place that's not big on fancy atmosphere but is fresh new and clean at the time of this review. \r\n\r\nThe savory baked goods are Pasty in vegetable or beef and are very large in size.\r\n\r\nThe medium size savory baked good is the house made sausage roll. \r\n\r\nSmaller but enough are the pies that come in many varieties.\r\n\r\nWe sampled two pies and one sausage roll. I thought the Steak Curry Pie was delicious and it was my favorite but the steak was a tad chewy just like in the Steak Mushroom Pie. The Sausage in the Sausage Roll was tasty but a tad dry with it's grease released in the pastry.\r\n\r\nMy husband did a great job eating the food so I had room to try a dessert.\r\n\r\nThey didn't have all the desserts for sale that they posted on the menu board but they were selling three desserts on my visit.\r\n\r\nThey were offering a vanilla slice that looked very similar to a nepolian, apple turnovers and an Australian Dessert called a Lamingtons filled and unfilled. \r\n\r\nI went with the Lamington unfilled. It was a DELICIOUS light spongy cake frosted with GOOD chocolate and dusted with coconut. The cake was excellent. It tasted like pound cake and angel food had a baby.\r\n\r\nGood visit overall\r\n\r\nThree stars is positive and means worth a try!\r\n\r\nAfter all this might be the only Australian Eatery in Metro Phoenix so that means it's the BEST Australian Eatery in the Metro Phoenix Area.  I really should give this place one more try, as everything does look tasty, but in my case I guess I ordered the wrong item. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the staff was very attentive and nice. The place is clean, but empty. \r\n\r\nI ordered the sausage pastry, probably my first mistake, but it did look good. When I bit into it a glob of warm oil ran down my chin and onto the plate. The sausage no longer had a cooked appearance, but a rare to med rare look. Oil pooled out of its wrap and I immediately lost my appetite. So much for breakfast .\r\n\r\nI've read many of the four and five star reviews at this location and I'm just assuming I picked a bad day and a bad product. I'm willing to give this place another chance, but it will be a while. And I won't be ordering that sausage wrap anymore.  I love this place and come every week to get a delicious sausage roll, but they raised the price $2.00 so I guess I won't be coming as often. I can understand a need for price increases but 40% is more than I want to afford. I hope the increase will offset the loss of my business.  My wife and I stumbled across this on Yelp. Stopped by today and it exceeded every expectation! We got the bacon and cheese sausage roll and the cottage pie and they were beyond perfect! They even threw in some insanely delicious pavlova cookies for us. We'll be back regularly for sure.  Food to die for, been here everyday for a week.\r\nA taste of home for me. Great friendly staff, seem more like friends than staff.\r\nA must do if your in the area.\r\nAuthentic Aussie tucker. \r\nA M A Z I N G  Grandma turned 90 and has always wanted to go to Australia. I heard about this place on the news and decided to pick up some meat pies, sausage rolls and desserts to bring grandma a taste of Australia. \r\n\r\nOur favorites were the steak pie, curry pie and quiche sausage roll. For dessert the winner was the vanilla slice and we also tried the lamington and matchsticks.  husband and i went there last year when we was visiting inlaws. the food was good and amazing. definetly got to eat there again the next time we r in town  Being from New Zealand, the name drew me in and I was pretty excited to see the selection of classic down-under bakery fare, all the favorites from my childhood - pies, scones, custard slices and lamingtons. All things that you would be hard pressed to find outside of Oz or NZ. I got a chicken pie and a lamington. My kids, who were skeptical of a pie with meat in it, were pleasantly surprised. My son said "this is delicious!", and it was. I talked briefly to the owner who was super friendly and said he\'s going to start shipping pies soon and was in the process of expanding to include a bar with down under beer and wine. My only regret is that we lived in Scottsdale for ten years but I never made it to this place before. I\'ll certainly be back whenever I visit Scottsdale though. YUM!  You need to find this place!!!  It\'s not often that a restaurant opens in Scottsdale that rings truly unique...The Great Australian Bakery is filling that void!  Although "meat pies" and "pastys" aren\'t purely original, this place does them PERFECTLY.  \r\nThe Shepherd\'s Pie is insanely tasty and the Red Curry has a great blend of curry and comfort.  Save room for dessert because the Apple dessert of greatness is worth the trip alone!  So glad Scottsdale has another good place to hit up!  The iced caramel latte is so smooth and creamy. I love it!  I finished it way too fast, made me sad. Now I know where to go next time I'm in old town and want a coffee  Ive never eaten Australian delicacies before, so this place was a welcome change to monotony! I enjoyed it. It is not a very huge with extremely well-done interiors. But the location in Old Towne Scottsdale and food flavours made it a great experience.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I ordered the Anzac Biscuit and Lamington to go with our Ice Tea and Coffee. The coconut goodness of the Anzac was really yummy! The Lamington is a simple vanilla sponge cake topped with chocolate ganache and coconut. We'll definitely be visiting this place again ... but we will opt for a to-go order, The Old Towne and parks nearby will provide great views of Scottsdale to enjoy with this yummy food!  Thank you once again for opening.\r\n  I'm an Australian native who has been in the USA for 22 years. It's so nice to have a little slice of home. Your pastries are spot on. I'm very excited for your Aussie bar to open next door.\r\n  Thanks for the great service and food. I forgive you for being from Sydney lol.  I've been in Scottsdale for many years and don't think I've ever stepped inside this storefront on Main St in Old Town Scottsdale.  There's always a first for everything.\r\n\r\nIt's a little bit of an odd space with a fairly large open dining area in the center and separate offices or retail along the side.  In fact, I wasn't too wild about the layout or the decor.\r\n\r\nAs you walk up to the counter you'll see the menu posted above and the sweet and savory pastries in the display cases.  I chose a sausage roll and it was pretty meaty and flavorful.\r\n\r\nThe service was friendly but the whole experience didn't really wow me.  A light lunch of steak and mushroom pie washed down with iced tea was all I was planning to have when I walked into this bakery, but the pie was so tasty that it kicked my appetite up a few notches and I wanted to try another item. I decided to get the vegetable pasty - it was so good, with flaky puff pastry covering a well-seasoned medley of vegetables. The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere very informal, and the prices are great. This is a great stop for a quick meal or snack during a jaunt around Old Town Scottsdale.  The food was pretty good but going in was slightly awkward. The owner came up to the counter mid-order and started talking about how amazing his food was and how we couldn't get food like that anywhere else. He spent a ton of time talking about himself and even offered me a job. It was a bit on the creepy side. I politely told him I'd think about it but I already have a job. My fianc\xc3\xa9 was uncomfortable with the situation because the owner seemed to only be interested in me. I felt like I was being flirted with. Took the food to go but not sure if I'll be back.  My wife and I stopped in for something different for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  We were the only ones around so I was a little hesitant.  Interesting selection of Australian baked goods.  We shared a bacon and cheese roll and a small Lamington both of which were new experiences.   They were both  quite good although I didn't see or taste any cheese in the roll so I asked the proprietor who told me it is mixed in with the bacon and other meats.  Don't expect traditional Yankee bacon either.  It's almost undetectable when combined with the other meats in the mix.  The puff pastry was very flaky and tasty.  Their rolls are hardy and filling.  The Lamington was a sweet surprise - a sort of sponge cake wrapped in a chocolate gnash sprinkled with coconut.\r\n\r\nThey tout their coffee as the best around but I say nay nay.  My wife's mocha looked like chocolate milk and my Americano was weak.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice place for something different but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to return.  We spotted this place and decided to grab some to go on our way out of Old Town. (We were still full from lunch!)\r\nI walked in and asked some questions that were answered by the breathtakingly gorgeous Aussie guy behind the counter. After some discussion we decided the sausage roll and the Lamington were the 2 'most Aussie' things to try.\r\nThey did not disappoint. ... DELICIOUS! The entire family asking if we can go back tomorrow! \r\nThe items lend themselves well to sharing, so if we do go back, we would likely order many different things and divide each into fourths!\r\nThe service was friendly, witty, intelligent (did I mention gorgeous?) \r\nMade this middle aged lady's day! Swing by this bakery if you are in Scottsdale!  I love surprises, here there were a few:\r\n\r\n1. Iced coffee was awesome, great beans, strong but not overwhelming, did not get watered down when iced.\r\n2. Fresh authentic scones!  Get them with the raspberry and  the house made whipped cream, what a treat!\r\n3. A whole egg in the quiche, was definitely a surprise, jury is still out on whether it was a nice surprise or not.\r\n4. Service was outstanding, for Old Town,  that definitely  constitutes a welcome surprise!  Excellent pastries and coffee! Top notch service and friendly staff. Highly recommend this place in old town!  My wife is Australian so it was much surprise that we stumbled onto an Australian Bakery in the middle of Arizona. It was such a treat to have lamingtons with a Bundaberg... although we were a bit disappointed that they didn't serve flat whites.  My family and I went here for a quick snack. The service was great! Very nice people! But the food was... somewhat bland. I had a Vanilla Slice and it did not taste very Vanilla-y at all. The puff pastry top and bottom were very... tough to chew and cut. \r\n\r\nMy mom had the Chocolate Pie Tart... which tasted oddly salty with a hint of cocoa but nothing to write home about. \r\n\r\nI also tried my sister's Ice Cream sandwich.... which was DELICIOUS. The cookies were a coconut oatmeal cookie and they were filled with flavor!\r\n\r\nThe major Downside was that it cost us 25 dollars for two Pies, A Slice and and Ice Cream Sandwich... but I suppose I should expect that from a bakery that bakes their stuff from scratch.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say I'd eat here again but unfortunately my hope died with the food. Maybe someday I'll come back and try their savory menu... maybe then I my opinion will change.\r\n\r\nBut overall great service, the Style of the restaurant is very unique, and the atmosphere is very Australian (from the lack of Australia in my life except from TV.)  I was so excited to try out this place and it didn't disappoint.  We tried the spinach and feta roll, shepard's pie and vanilla slice for dessert - wow, so tasty!  There were so many amazing choices and I'll have to come back and try them all out.  Decided to come here for my bday lunch.  Good choice!  I got the Steak and Cheese Meat Pie (Chunky steak filling with cheddar cheese. Topped with cheddar cheese and salt and pepper.), it was great!  Tried a bite of the Sausage Roll (Flaky puff pastry filled with a ratio of 2 parts ground pork to 1 part ground beef.), It was delicious.  I also ordered and inhaled the Vanilla Slice (Vanilla slices are made with homemade thick yellow custard, sandwiched between two sheets of flaky puff pastry and topped with vanilla fondant and chocolate drizzle dessert).  MUST TRY if you love custard.  Only con was we had to wipe our own table down.  The sign outside says best coffee in Scottsdale so we got the cold brew. It's very similar to Nordstrom's blend, which is my favorite. I got the steak curry pie and it was delicious. It's like a pasty, empanada, or piroshky. The crust was buttery and flaky and held the deliciousness in without it falling apart. The baked goods also looked good too but I didn't have any room. They're adding a bar and more food options inside. Definitely check them out if you're looking for a quick bite!  I found this place while searching for a restaurant on Yelp. The meat pies are great and the owner is a nice guy from Sydney, Australia. Definitely a hidden gem in Old Town!  Never seen anything like this. Chicken cheese avocado topped off with a Bundaburg Ginger beer. \r\nOwner is really friendly. \r\nDefinitely check this place out!  Although still very much a work in progress as of April 2016, the sausage rolls, beef mince pies and lamingtons are tasty enough for a bakery in Australia to be proud of.  Delicious! Quick, friendly, and clean. Love it here! Come for hearty savory and sweet pastry and leave full and satisfied! Nom nom nom!  Loved being able to walk around Old Town Scottsdale and find this hidden gem! We are not local but ended up stopping to walk around. We bypassed the usual tacky tourist shops, and were pleasantly surprised when we peeked in here. Both sweet and savory bakery items are baked in-house every day. If it weren't for the fact we had eaten breakfast only an hour previously before we stopped by, we could have easily stocked up a tray and ate a lot and called it lunch! Hubby ordered a custard type pie, and I had a sausage roll. We were intrigued by the Lamington and were allowed to sample that. The specialty coffee drinks made by the barista are a little on the expensive side, but they also sell a variety of water, sodas, juice and milk in fridges. Definitely a treat, and highly recommend to anyone who visits Scottsdale to stop by!  Looking for something that is not the norm? Look no further the the great Australian bakery, the steak and cheese pie is divine and the lamington is to die for. Keep up the good work!  The red chicken curry is so flavorful. The curry is a perfect Thai red curry, which is hard to find in the valley. The crust is perfectly made, not too soaky not too dry. I can use one hand to eat it, which means that the filling and the crust are perfect. \r\n\r\nAnother tasty one is chicken avocado. I cannot wait to go back to try different pies.  The only way this place could improve is if it were in Australia. After living in Australia for 5 years myself, these pies are authentic and delicious. A little pricier then what I'm used to spending but it is to be expected and I feel it was worth it. We will definitely return time and time again!! I highly recommend you try this place - you won't be disappointed!  This is a great bakery to enjoy some goodies and relax for a minute in Old Scottsdale. I'm always looking for a new spot for sweets, but this bakery has much more than just sweets. \r\n\r\nThe inside of the bakery was oddly spacious with the display of goodies in the back corner. There are several tables so that you can enjoy your delicious treats right away. The employee that helped us was quick to greet us and answered questions, but was not overly friendly. \r\n\r\nWe came in for sweets, but found that this bakery offers plenty of savory options too. The variety of meat pies and sausage rolls was impressive. Everything looked great. Next time I'll come for breakfast and enjoy the savory options.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I shared a Strudel that was filled with apricot. Very good! The pastry was delicious and the filling was not overly sweet. The Anzac Biscuit was my favorite of the two sweets though. It reminded me of the buttery, sugary flavor of an oatmeal cookie. It was a uniquely delicious cookie. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law ordered a small chocolate pie that they said was delicious too.  Was just walking by with the family when we saw this place. Sausage rolls were great, good food, friendly service, couldn't ask for a better experience.  This place is like walking into a bakery with all the items in a display case and ordering what you want and sitting down at the tables to eat. No waitress. \r\n\r\nIt was only us when we were in there so it felt weird but with my husband being part Aussie we couldn't refuse the selection of pot pies.\r\n\r\nBetween 5 of us we had the Sausage roll, couple steak and mushroom, couple curry pies, a minced meat pie, and for dessert we tried their apricot strudel. \r\n\r\nThe pies hit the spot. We were all so full. \r\n\r\nWe walked around the town after and was well satisfied with these Pot pies. \r\n\r\nA Yay to say come on in and trying this place. \r\n\r\nIf I lived here, I'd recommend popping these in the microwave for 10 seconds so they'd taste like they came out the oven. Same with the desserts, after placing them in the microwave so it's nice and hot place a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They are huge enough to cut into a few pieces. Your dinner guest will love it.  The name suggests greatness, and as a pastry connoisseur I was very excited to try this place. Unfortunately my expectations were not met...\r\n\r\nI thought it would be a neat little bakery in old town, but it's basically just a casual deli environment that isn't very inviting. I decided to order a bunch of pastries to go for our family dinner that evening; I went with a some quiches, a curry pie, a beef pie, a pasty, a sausage roll, a matchstick, a turnover, and a lamington. We were all anxious to dive in, but were all disappointed with the mediocre flavors and quality of the pastry. They were all decent, but nothing truly great. Out of everything we tried I would say that the matchstick and sausage roll were the best. On the bright side the prices are reasonable and the staff is very nice and helpful. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a quick bite this might be a decent place to do so, but if you want a great pasty or other pastries there are better places nearby.  4 to 4.5 stars.  This place was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I both thought the food was really delicious and high quality.  The prices are a little too high, IMO, on the dessert items.  For the meat pies, it's fair.  Steak and mushroom pie was very filling and only one small piece of tough steak, honestly a lot more flavorful and good steak than I expected.  Bacon quiche and sausage roll both great.  I loved the apricot streudel, filling did not come out of a can and it was not too sweet.  The pastry dough is well made.  All the desserts were more like asian-style low sweetness, which is what I prefer.  Lamington, custard pie, and Anzac was good, not blown away.  Be careful not to over-order like we did, the items look small but they are dense and filling.\r\n\r\nCold brew was very strong!  If you are sensitive to caffeine, stick to the small size.  Delicious food! Went in bought one pie to share with the family and walked right back in and we tried almost everything, my favorite was the stake and mushroom pie. The staff was very helpful and super nice also the owner Laurance was very nice and explain the idea he wants to the area with his business and his food. And the coffee it's excellent, they have their own blend, lots of flavor and strong. Definitely coming back!  This place is a gem! Authentic Australian pastries at reasonable prices. The owner came out and had a good chat with him, great service! These guys deserve to win! Check this place out.  Great little authentic Australian bakery in Old town Scottdale!!  Delicious "pasty" and sausage roll.  Flaky and so good!  They also served lots of other sweet and savory pastries and lattes.  Don\'t miss the charming Australian accents and yummy food!  Glad this place is here. Great espresso drinks and a variety of Australian baked goods including sausage rolls. There's even a koala in the tree. Dog and child friendly patio. They have a new bar inside for you to chug down your Foster's. You know you want to. So come check it out. Super friendly people!  Best meat pie I've had since Australia! Can't believe it took so long to find. I will be back frequently.  Yummy food. We tried a sampling of the hand pies & desserts and everything was great. The spinach & feta hand pie and vanilla cake were my favorites! Definitely stop in and check this place out!  I had no idea that pasties are an Aussie staple as are Pies and sausage rolls I kid you not.\r\nDon't believe me go check out this Australian Bakery in beautiful Old Town Scottsdale.\r\n\r\n~Red Chicken curry $6.50 (marinated curry chicken, slices of onion, bell pepper and mushroom, in a spicy coconut sauce. Topped with red paprika powder)\r\n~Chicken Mornay $6 (chunks of chicken saut\xc3\xa9ed with carrots, corn, peas and red bell pepper, creamy cheddar sauce)\r\n~Chicken Cheese Avocado $6.50 (chunks of marinated chicken saut\xc3\xa9ed with carrots filled with slices of ripe avocado and cheddar cheese)\r\n~Rosemary Chicken & Potato $6 (Chunks of chicken, in rosemary lemon marinade stuffed with garlic roasted potatoes in a flaky pastry)\r\n~Apple Turnover $4 (Apple pie filling in a flaky puff pastry)\r\n\r\nThe chicken curry pie is the winner hands down!\r\nAll pies\\/pasties are generously stuffed with chunks of meat and are about $6 which is very affordable.The crust is flaky and the pies are fresh.\r\nThe Apple turnover had a soft crust with powdered sugar and the right amount of sweetness.\r\n\r\nI can't wait to try all the other items on their menu.They also sell frozen pies and rolls which you can warm at home.I visit them frequently and the quality of pies\\/pasties is consistently top-notch.\r\n\r\nCheers!  Nice open space in the heart of Old Town. The "hook" is an Aussie menu. There\'s an assortment of pasties, sausage rolls, and the like plus typical Australian desserts.  The chunky steak pasty was  tasty, as was the cottage pie.  The bacon and cheese quiche was good but didn\'t seem particularly fresh. If I return, I\'ll stick with the desserts. The lamington was tasty. Fresh sponge cake covered with coconut.  Nice!  Great find!  Have a mince pie or sausage roll but leave room for dessert!!  Will be back!!  Amazing! Meat pies and apple turnovers oh my! Stopped in on the bar side for a cold one while shopping then the bakery side on the way home for a treat. Holy cow, delicious. Wish I could take them home to Ohio.  I downgraded my review from 5 to 4.  I love the location, I love the delicious food, the atmosphere, and the service.  I was extremely disappointed with the staff obviously not preparing for lunch.  I entered the building around 12:20 and the pickings were very thin.  There were no sausage rolls at all and the glass cabinet was sparse in terms of other choices.  In my opinion this is unacceptable.  If I managed this place that wouldn't happen.  I need to know when I go there that I can choose anything there on the menu, and it is available especially at the beginning of lunch.  I have a 1\\/2 an hour for lunch. Also it wasn't very busy at all, maybe 8 customers if that.  Horrible service! Slow and everyone in line had an issue. The menu prices were out of date and people were walking out. After 20 min in line the cashier walked away and I walked out. Pathetic!  Wow! I didn't expect Australian Pastries to taste this good. Last time I went to Australia, all I ate was seafood and now I regret not having any of this during my travel. \r\n\r\nMy friends and I had been talking about coming here for quite some time now. Yesterday, we've decided to drive up here and give it a shot (even though the wind was 30 MPH outside). The restaurant looks like a small food court. I saw at least two other retail stores sharing the same space at the end of the alley, but it doesn't bother me at all. I was there for good food, not for trying to get fine dining experience in old town Scottsdale like other stuck up Scottsdale folks do (comments as reflected on other yelpers review. I just have to say something). I've done quite a bit of travelling around the world and found that some of the best food is served at places such as this. You should judge the place by it's food & services, not where it is located. ANYWAYS, service was great and welcoming. Workers were hardworking even towards the end of the night. Since we've never been there, they waited for us to pick what we wanted patiently without giving us an attitude for it. \r\n\r\nThere were so muxh to choose from i didnt even know where to start. I asked them which pasty on the shelf is the most popular. Apparently, it's the sausage pastry. The pastry was soft and flakey. The sausages were well seasoned and tasty. I didn't think that small size one was going to fill me up but it actually did. I also took a bite of everyone else's. They were all just as good. \r\n\r\nIll definitely come here again especially for their sausage pastry.  I had an okay lunch here a few weeks ago, but my mind wasn't blown away by the meat pie. I had steak and mushroom and the overwhelming flavor I had was Worcestershire Sauce, which is fine since I'm sure it's an ingredient, but it should not be the star player in the flavors.  I think if I come back I'll try something else and maybe also a sweet pie.  The customer service was friendly enough, which made up for the fact that the food wasn't a big hit with me.\r\n\r\nI do feel I'd be in remiss if I didn't point out that my very good friend was raised in New Zealand and he says this is the closest he can get to a yummy meat pie from back home.  So there's that going for them in terms of authenticity too.  Got a soy cappuccino and the steak and cheese pie. Both were really good. Authentic Australian food. Great job guys!  I had the meat pie, way too much Worcestershire sauce for my taste.  But my friends thought it was okay.  I guess if you favor authentic pies, you might try the place.  It did piss me off to have owner coming running out with two orange cones \r\nas I was about to park, reserving his space.  His corvette ( red with "Aussie" plates) was parked two spots over but evidently he feels entitled to a space.  Arrogant ass.  It\'s public parking.  You don\'t get a reserved spot. I had to wait for him to pull out and move his car over two spaces so I could park.  That and mediocre food won\'t have me returning  I've been twice now. First time had a sausage roll that was great. Next time had a beef curry pie that was awesome.  Also tried a lemington. Very tasty desert. Great food. Quick service.  Visiting from L.A. And saw a Australian flag and remembered reading about Aussie pies. Decided to get a little\r\nPie to share with hubby and teenage daughter for a snack. Got the Sausage roll after talking to Ian who was so gracious in describing what he had in the case. Got in car and I took a bite and could not stop. It was so delicious I ate the whole roll! At first I thought I would eat a third, then kept driving and ate half, couldn't stop eating it! It was that good! I had to turn back and get another one for hubby and daughter!!  Ian said they have happy hour for the food! Couldn't believe it! You can't go wrong with this place! They even have vegetarian pies and sweet pies! Enjoy!!!  It's on my bucket list to visit Australia sometime, but for now eating their cuisine will be the best I can do! This cute little shop sells savory and sweet pies. The mouthwatering pie selections are mainly chicken and beef savory options, with a few vegetarian pies and desserts. I opted for a chunky beef pie ($7.29) and tried a few other items. The pie had a crispy flaky crust and well seasoned beef in a wine sauce. The beef was a little chewy but overall it was enjoyable. I also tried the sausage roll which I think is the best deal for your money ($4.50). It was filled with a lot of ground meat encased in flaky pastry. The bite of shepherd's pie I had was equally tasty and filling as well as a beef and vegetable pasty I tried a bit of.\r\n\r\nDrinks are by the bottle and are in a fridge off to the side. In addition to Coke products they have Australian ginger beer which had a spicy kick to it which I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWe finished our meal by sharing an apple turnover. The dessert had been refrigerated so the dough wasn't as flaky as the savory pies but I did enjoy the sweet fruity filling. \r\n\r\nThe decor is basic but cute with lots of photos of Australia, kangaroos and koalas. There is plenty of seating and we had no problems dining in on a Saturday early evening. Note that they close at 7 PM each day so get here early if you want to dine for dinner.\r\n\r\nOverall this is a great inexpensive and fast option for food if you're in Old Town Scottsdale. I'll be back to try more pie!  This is a great new place in Old Town Scottsdale, owned by an authentic Aussie! We have been there twice in the past two days. Get there as soon as you can! \r\n\r\nJust passing by when we weren't hungry the first time, we opted for an appealing matchstick pastry. Then yesterday we went there hungry for breakfast. My wife had the spinach and feta roll. I had the favorably reviewed sausage roll, finding it unique, delectable, and generous. \r\n\r\nAfter the savories, we shared the most amazing apple turnover! Luckily we live about three blocks from The Great Australian Bakery and we're thinking we want to eat our way through the entire menu! \r\n\r\nWhether you've been to Australia or not, you'll love this place. The pastries used around the savories and sweets are flaky and, we think, just perfect!  TGAB is something delightfully different in Old Town. Can't wait to go back!  Love this place for a quick bite. Service is brilliant  the chunky steak was a little dry.... Needs more sauce. The taste was good   Will be back  I have tried their food twice now and cannot wait to come back! My mouth is watering just thinking about their sausage rolls. They also offer some wonderful catering options that are so unique and different from the usual bagels or doughnuts. This place is a must-try for anyone looking for a delicious snack and some of the best coffee in town!!!!  It was great to get a taste of Australia again! Recently 10 of us on a cricket tour stopped in for a Sunday morning breakfast. The coffee was great, the service was very friendly and you have to try the sausage rolls. As most of us were ex-pats we are pretty familiar with a good pie and no-one left dissapointed. Hats off to Laurence and the team, great work and we look forward to seeing you again.  What a sweet little place in the heart of old town. The selection of meat pies is fantastic and then there are the desserts! so much to choose from, only one stomach! Have been several times and tried something different each time, they have all been fabulous. \r\nTIP: get on their mailing list!  I was not impressed with the savory food because it was too salty and the bacons & cheese quiche was hard & crunchy. The sweets were much better. The counter person was friendly & helpful.  Restaurant has been on my bookmark list for too long so when I passed by on a morning bike ride it was time to stop in.  The spinach feta pie was calling my name which held its own with some of my other local favorite bakeries quiche version of the same.  We are impressed with the quality and style of this fast self serve concept. The tidy display cases show off the perfectly proportioned turnovers, and rolled savory pastry. Traditional meat and vegetarian options, we had the Apple turnover which was perfect, not too sweet. The iced cold brew was tasty, but needs a shot of espresso to fortify. We will try it for lunch next time.  Nothing like classic Aussie comfort food like a savory meat pie.  Located in the heart of Old Town.   I was finally able to try one of the popular pies amongst the locals which is the chicken cheese and avocado.  The two previous times I stopped by they were sold out.  It tasted like a chicken club sandwich wrapped in a flaky pie crust.  Unique and not something traditionally you would find down under.  \r\n\r\nBut since that that wasn't available the first thing I ever tried was the steak and mushroom pie.  Chunks of sirloin and the mushrooms were so thinly sliced that I couldn't even couldn't even taste them but that's fine by me.  But it's a hearty pie and filling!  I'll be back to try the Curry Beef Pie.  \r\n\r\nThe samples of the lamingtons spongebcakey bites are a nice little treat if you've never tried it and like coconut flakes.  \r\n\r\n5 stars for these filling pies made with quality ingredients and look out for the expanded bar area as well coming soon at this location to catch your favorite Aussie rugby club as well.  Great little place in Old Town Scottsdale.  They are fairly new, only open 3 months but are delivering some great tasting meat pies and desserts.  Limited soda selection but they are in the process of opening a bar so by the fall they should have more beverage coices.  I thought the sausage roll was a little on the salty side but it still tasted great.  Not exactly a great vibe right now as a sit down place but great food to go.  The sausage rolls are legit! Despite them being a mouthful and far larger than the ones I would eat at children's birthday parties when I was a kid, the pastry dough that encases the sausage is so flaky and delicious! Like with pizza, it's all about the crust, the same can be said for savories, it's all about the dough! The Red Curry Chicken is another must, it has a slight spice but I feel it's missing a yogurt garnish of sorts. I love that I work in old town and it's a short jaunt down to the bakery, I expect many future visits there!  Very good, flakey pastry! The inside of my Bacon Cheddar quiche was a little bland. Service was good, and quick.  Seriously was soo excited when I heard we were getting some Aussie meat pies in town! We always get them frozen from New Zealand or Australia. But dang these are delicious. The food is great service was great!  I have never been to Australia, but the fare served here reminds me a lot of the types of foods I've enjoyed during my visits to England over the years.\r\n\r\nWhether you're craving a mincemeat pie, steak and kidney pie, steak and mushroom pie, sausage roll, scones, or other assorted pastries this is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that everything is a-la carte and putting together a meal gets a bit pricey. I wish they would offer some combo meals that include meat pie, side dish and a drink. \r\n\r\nThey do have some combos if you are ordering a large amount of food for a party or group event but nothing for individuals.\r\n\r\nThere's also not much atmosphere to the place as its a large open space with a cafeteria feel.\r\n\r\nOverall though it's a good place to eat.  I'm being generous because I didn't try any of their pastries, just the savory stuff, and that wasn't very good.  One problem may be that it is not freshly baked, such as you would get at the nearby Cornish Pasty Company.  Another issue is that the fillings are one-dimensional - they need spicing, accent ingredients, etc.  The dough, too, is without character.  I hope the desserts are better.  Great food, the Feta & Spinach Roll was fantastic. I had the Apple Strudel and it was great as well! Definitely recommend, can't wait to try more!  Found this place while wandering around old town scottsdale on a business trip.  No one told me that nothing in Old town Scottsdale is open before 10 and I with my jet lag was walking around at 8 am in the morning in like a ghost town.  The only little shop open was the bakery.  Great customer service ( they let me sit for an hour milking my meal and chatted about the place). They have small versions of some of the pies and I tried their mince pie, mornay, and the spinach feta.  All super tasty.  My favorite was the spinach and feta.  They make a yummy tomato ketchup sauce that is so good with the mince pie too!  Definitely a nice surprise to find an Australian bakery in Arizona!  Food was 3.5.  Solid food.  The chicken curry pie was good; not great.  The rosemary chicken pasty was good.  Crust and pastry was great.   The lemington was perfect.  \r\n\r\nAmbience is slapdash.  Throwing a couple of Aussie flags and a stuffed kangaroo doesn't make ambience.  The space is huge and it appears that they are constructing a new bar.  But for god's sake, hide the work.  I can see bicycles ladders, construction material in the space next to the bakery part.  \r\n\r\nThe space looks like they had a counter bakery with Basic tables and a construction site.  Ambience -- 2\r\n\r\nThe owner is very friendly Native Aussie but the staff leave me wondering if friendliness is just limited to the owner.   Customer service -- 2.5\r\n\r\noverall a 3.  However if they add ambience and service this place could be awesome.  Friendly Unique AUSTRALIAN MADE FOOD!!! I had the mince pie with mashed potato and peas amazing!!! Authentic Australia Flair. Stop in on Friday or Saturday for high quality LIVE  music!  They Cater!\r\nThe Great Australian Bakery catered a breakfast event for our organization. We had 100 people in attendance and everyone LOVE the food. They had sausage rolls, bacon & cheese quiches, Spinach & feta quiches, veggie pie, and a full assortment of their delicious baked treats. Their staff is so friendly and did a great job interacting with our guests. I would highly recommend them for your next event. I love that their food is unique and delicious. We all get tired of the same sandwiches and doughnuts.\r\nCheers!  Found this place after walking around downtown.  Tried two different sausage rolls and a custard pie.  All were fantastic.  Will come back again to try a curry pie.  The lamington sample was nice bonus.  Soft sponge cake with ganache and coconut.  It was the best, most moist cake I've had in a really long time!  Such a great treat in Old Town.  Unassuming little place that sprouted up in what was once a lobby for small mall.  Its a wonderful assortment of meat (and other) pies and desserts.  I had the chunky steak pie and it was out of this world.  I look forward to trying a few other things over the next few months.  This place is awesome!  Walking around in the desert heat and I needed something to revive me. The staff in here were so sweet and friendly.  I loved that they actually seemed to enjoy chatting with their guests. I was shown where they make all their pastries- everything in-house. With some help from the guy behind the counter I decided on the ANZAC bisquit with an iced coffee spider (iced coffee with caramel syrup and a scoop of ice cream). Both were delicious and just enough sugar to get me through the rest of my afternoon.  Dropped by here for a bite as I was in the area. Tried the traditional and creamy zucchini... Loved it! The pie crust was flaky, lots of texture. The fillings were seasoned very well, nice balance overall and super yummy! :) I liked it so much I bought the fav4 pack to go to bring home! Their coffee is also really good. The expression blend was excellent. Totally enjoyed my cup of joe :) would definitely come by next time I'm down in the area again! Seems\r\nPretty authentic :) staff are super friendly and helpful with suggestions as well!  It's pricey for the size of pie. $7 for a pie the size of your palm. often times they run out of the flavour. also no place to seat so best is for take-out  Kanga, where have you been all my life? After sampling Kanga's Aussie meat pies at a Yelp's Summer Fling event, Kanga has officially become my favourite pie joint. Their 100% butter pastry Aussie meat pies are INCREDIBLE! The traditional Aussie minced beef pies in tomato and vegemite gravy are out of the world. \r\n\r\na splash of ketchup + a splash of surfer love = sinfully delicious 3.14\r\n\r\nThe creamy zucchini pie is just as (if not more) delightful! The pie consists of peppery garlic cream cheese sauce, mixed with roasted zucchini, caramelized onion and some extremely addictive substance I cannot put my finger on. \r\n\r\nWell played Kanga, well played. I will be back in my stretchy pants for your Kiwi Classic, The Canadian (Steak & Bacon), Butter Chix, Mum's Chicken Pie, El Diablo, Mates' Masala, Brekkie, sausage roll and spinach roll!  I really wanted to like this place. I really, REALLY wanted to. But somehow I just didn't. I ordered three different pies through Hurrier and got to eat them in the comfort of my own home...but they just weren't very good. I ordered the Diablo with pulled pork and mashed potatoes, the original, and the kiwi classic. They were edible...but I found the crust was very dry and they were a bit overlooked, and there really wasn't much filling in any of the pies. They were simply underwhelming. I probably wouldn't order from there again.  I love savoury pies but these pies somehow didn't really hit the spot. The pie crust was kind of dry and not very flavourful. The filling was good however but I was really craving some mash to go with it.The size of the pie is also very small. I would say the pies are more of a snack than a full meal.  Baked fresh every day! These tasty pies are an awesome grab and go type of meal. I've been back multiple times and every bite is DELICIOUS! My personal favourite is the Mum's Chicken Pot Pie! I've got a sweet tooth and the Billionaire Shortbread bars are an awesome way to top the meal off! Everything is made from quality ingredients and worth every penny (real butter, locally source and hormone free meat). Will be back soon!  Aussie pies? Never even heard of such a thing (I apologize if I've insulted anyone). But damn! this stuff is GOOD.\r\n\r\nAn assortment of gooey, saucey and flavourful fillings wrapped in a flaky, buttery phyllo crust. What more can one ask for? Aromatic and tastes off the charts!\r\n\r\nI don't know of any other places in the GTA that serve meat pies and especially Aussie meat pies so I can't compare But whatever I have eaten here, be it chicken, beef or just simply veggies, they are all so satisfying. Butter chicken is my favourite so far.\r\n\r\nThe only quibble I have is that one is just not quite enough and 2 maybe a bit much. They are an odd size (about the size of a clench fist).\r\n\r\nThey also have this stuff frozen and in bulk so you can eat this stuff at home.\r\n\r\nDefinitely drop by and give them a try. I love this stuff.  Kaanga caters in pies, pies pies, not only pies, Australian pies on top of that (not like I know what's the difference between normal pie and an Australian pie). \r\n\r\nSo it's on Duncan, right on the west side of downtown, I have been there 3 times and tried,\r\n\r\n1. Mates masala: it has Indian chick peas curry inside. It's spicy, right amount. You would think the filling is a bit weird, but it totally works with the crust. \r\n\r\n2. I got the pork and mashed potatoes: this is the only one I didn't like because of the filling. The pulled pork was kinda ok, but the mashed potatoes were not tasty. Also carb in a pie is not such a good idea. \r\n\r\n3. Sausage roll: lightly spiced sausage with hints of fennel. Amazing \r\n\r\n4. Spinach roll: creamy spinach and cheese roll , the filling is amazing, spinach and cheese makes it. \r\n\r\nIt's a must go if you like pies. But it's on pricier side$7 for a small pie.  Heard good things about this place and I really wanted to try. Walked by the other day and thought I really need to grab some. \r\n\r\nThe place is super small so it\'s more like a take-out or a quick bite place. It\'s a little hidden off to a side street and you may not notice it if you are just browsing on Queen. The staff behind the counter wasn\'t really friendly. Since it was my first time there, I wasn\'t sure what was offered and I didn\'t know what was in the pies. But even though she saw that I was confused, the girl behind the counter still didn\'t help me. Finally I found a menu "postcard" on top of the counter and I looked at that. They offer rolls, pies, lunch combos as well as frozen pies you can take home. I went up to the girl and told her that I wanted a Kiwi Classic, Pepper steak, El Diablo and Spinach roll. \r\n\r\nBefore she went and grabbed the pies that I wanted, she proceeded to ask what the person behind me had wanted. I understand (kind of) why she did this, so that the person behind me didn\'t have to wait as long, because he ordered a combo with fries. But honestly, you just need to grab the four things off the shelf it will take like 30 seconds. So instead of only waiting 30 seconds for my food, I had to wait more than 5 mins. Because everytime she grabbed a pie for me, she would go do something for the customer behind me (put fries in the fryer, warm his pie, put it on a plate. Therefore the person who\'s ordering a combo (who probably had expected to wait a bit longer) doesn\'t have to wait as long, but me who\'s ordering takeout (who expects it to be fast) have to wait longer. It really doesn\'t make sense to me. \r\n\r\nOf course it was only a few minutes, but I was sort of in a hurry (back to work) and I was sort of pissed that she was serving the guy behind me, when I was there before him. The pies were alright, pepper steak had big chucks of steak in it. It honestly didn\'t taste much better than a frozen one you get at the grocery store. The El Diablo was hard on top, because of the potato and the consistency didn\'t seem right cause it was hard to bite into it on top. The Kiwi was actually my favourite because I thought the minced meat was much better in the pies. The spinach roll was nothing special. \r\n\r\nOverall the food is okay. The location not that great and I did not enjoy the service at all.  My husband and I had these pies last weekend and I wish we got more! The pie crust was perfect and the fillings were all so flavourful. They have 4 filling  types including a creamy zucchini one. Conveniently available at Kensington and Roncesvalles. I've also seen them at various food shows and events.\r\n\r\nI'll be going back for more soon! MUST TRY!  I stopped by here on the recommendation of my Aussie friend who recently discovered it.\r\n\r\nI had the chicken curry pie and though it was delicious, the $9 price tag threw me.  I was expecting a larger portion at that price.  When they handed over my tiny pie, I felt like someone was handing me one of those single serving frozen pies you can pick up at the grocery store, the kind you re-heat in your oven and serve with SIDES because one teensy tiny pie isn't a meal.  For $9, I expect a meal!\r\n\r\nAt that price, one visit is sufficient.  I tried it once - good enough.  I love this place!  I accidentally stumbled upon this place while walking to Queens Street.  I saw it on yelp, but forgot all about it until I was across the street.  I decided to come in and check it out!  \r\n\r\nThe pies are pricey for what they are, but they are delicious and totally worth stopping by!  I recommend you eating this hot or heating it up in the oven when you get home.  I like the little shaped cut outs in the pie.  Mine had a heart on it and I thought it was so cute!\r\n\r\nI tried the Canadian which was steak and bacon.  It was so so so good!  I also got the Butter Chix and that was delicious!  It wasn't spicy at all and I loved the curry flavor.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I thought was odd was the store said they close at 9pm.  I was there a little bit before 6pm on Saturday July 3 and this guy comes in.  He tries to order coffee and the girl working the counter said she already closed the coffee machine since they were closing at 6pm.  There were no signs saying they were closing early.  I felt bad for the guy.  Why would you refuse business?!  Little, warm, flakey bites of deliciousness! Oh so good!\r\nThey have a nice variety as well. I've had the Aussie traditional and the Kiwi classic, and they were very good!\r\n\r\nNot great for dining in, as you will not find a spot sit if it's too crowded. Although I love the hanging boomerangs. \r\nService was a tad slow, but the staff were really awesome.  Really small space on Duncan street in between Queen St and Richmond. We try to pick up frozen pies here regularly and whenever we come we can't resist having one. \r\n\r\nI get the kiwi classic almost every time. A few of my friends enjoy the butter chix which is yummy too. The pastry is so flaky and delicious. I've tried a bunch of the other fillings and they are all worth trying. Tried their flat white and I really quite enjoyed it here. Pastry (savory or sweet) and coffee just go together in my mind.\r\n\r\nBaking the pies at home are almost foolproof since even I can do it! :-) \r\n\r\nSeating is very limited here, kind of like a bar setup with high stools that overlook the street. They have really cool charging stations where you plug an adapter to your phone and place it over a marked spot and voila, your phone is charging. Downside is they are limited on how many adapters they have.  Must try: Butter Chix\r\n\r\nThis little pie shop offers a homey treat that will leave you wanting more. \r\n\r\nWe had the Butter Chix and the Mum\'s Chicken Pie, both were delicious and satisfying. Butter Chix definitely takes the "pie" (heh, get it) since it was super buttery and tasted exactly like the best bite of your chicken curry + nann combo. The chicken pie wasn\'t bad either (but may be because I have a soft spot for pot pies... to my friend apparently the filling tasted like those canned chicken pot pie soup?).\r\n\r\nThe price was a little steep though given the size... it will definitely be a once-in-a-while, if-I-deserve-it kind of treat.  I had the Traditional Aussie Meat Pie - Minced beef in a savoury gravy with a touch of vegemite.\r\n\r\nLoved this!! The meat was very delicious and went well with the gravy. The gravy was just the perfect amount - it wasn\'t soupy inside nor overpower the meat. The pastry was very fluffy, and to which I find they use butter instead of shortening (a win!). As they recommend, "best enjoyed with ketchup". Initially I was skeptical about adding ketchup because meat plus gravy was perfect already for me. But after trying it with ketchup, there is the salt + sour combination from the gravy and ketchup that just made everything more delicious!\r\n\r\nThe fresh cut fries were awesome too!\r\n\r\nAlso had their Flat White. This was a damn good flat white, using beans from Propeller Coffee. Love the taste and the smoothness of the drink. And best of all, I didn\'t feel the acidity that I feel on others.\r\n\r\nI will be back to try the other interesting pies like Kiwi Classic, El Diablo and The Canadian.  Dropped by here after reading raving reviews on Yelp. Well.. The pies were just 'ok'. Given the price, they are not cheap but the fillings were ..hmm...a bit underwhelming.  This is a tiny little hole in the wall that looks like half a bakery or diner. There are about six seats at a cramped bar, but you don't come here for ambiance.\r\n\r\nYou come for meat pies. My wife had the Kiwi, and I had the Canadian. They were both flaky and delicious, and not scalding hot as the sun, like most places serve pies.\r\n\r\nA tad pricey for what you get, but very tasty. If it's cold outside, and it was for mid-June, this is a nice place to stop and refuel.  4 stars, because I have only been here once. Consistency is key. The quality here is top notch. $7 for a quality product is not over the top. Really good food has a cerebral quality to it for me. The flakiness of the pastry, the butter, the savoury flavours and texture. Stop staring out the window during lunch and truly feel the flavours you are experiencing. If you want more food, then but another pie. If you are complaining about the prices, then go spend $13 at a mega fast food joint where the packaging has more nutrition and flavour then the food.  Great service from the gentlemen manning the counter. Really intrigued by these delicious smelling Aussie pies. Unfortunately thai dinner awaits. I will visit another time and endulge.  Walking by Kanga on my way to work, I decided to pick up the Traditional Aussie meat pie combo with a garden salad and their propellor coffee ($11 + tax). \r\n\r\nJust thinking about the perfect flaky texture of the puff pastry is making me hungry again. The pie was packed with minced meat and potato - Perfectly seasoned and not overly-sauced that it would leak through the pastry. The salad came in a small plastic container with the dressing on the side and it was A-OK for what it was. \r\n\r\nThe coffee was unfortunately, AWFUL! My first sip of it was sour and tasted like muddy water.. so I do not recommend getting coffee here. \r\n\r\nThere aren't many seats in this tiny establishment, so most customers are here for take out. I'll be back to try the other pie varieties, but probably not order it as a combo next time.  I love kanga pies!!! Soooo good!! Honestly all their pies are good.. the sausage roll not so much.. their puff pastry is perfect puff pastry. I would definitely recommend this place to others.  Stumbled into Kanga unexpectedly and I was super excited as I have heard good things about this place. It was mid-afternoon and there were a wide variety of pie to choose from. Pie also came out fresh from the oven and it smelled amazing!\r\nI opted for the Traditional Australian meat pie as one, I have never had one before so I thought why not keep it original and two, it was fresh out of the oven!\r\nI got this 'to go' and it was still really good after an hour before I got home. The pie crust was perfect- buttery and flakey. The filling was tasty with the right amount of meat filling.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be trying the other pies when I get a chance. Also they have these wireless chargers if you happen to have no juice in your phone and want to enjoy some pie!  Ive never been to Australia so I dont know what authentic Australian meat pie is supposed to look\\/taste like. All I know is that I've never seen an Australian meat pie shop anywhere else (outside of Toronto and America), everything is baked fresh daily, diff varieties, take debit and credit and did not rip off an idea from a restaurant\\/vendor aka original. I had the chicken pot pie inspired one and it was really good- chunks of chicken in a spicy curry-like sauce and the crust was super flaky and buttery. Yum. \r\n\r\nDefinitely coming back for more :)  Came here for Pi Day! We originally intended to go to Pie Squared, but they close at 7PM on Saturdays, so Kanga it was! Got there around 7:30ish and the only pies they had left were Traditional and Canadian. We bought one of each and split them.\r\n\r\nThe Traditional was definitely my favorite of the two. Full of flavor, with little chunks of potato and onion. The Canadian was more gravy-flavored with pieces of tender beef, however, I found myself adding sriracha to it to make it more interesting. As good as they are, I find them to be a tad over-priced. We came here for a special occasion but I can't see myself coming regularly for that price.\r\n\r\nThe place was being taken care of by one woman who was friendly and nice. I liked the fact that they have charge spots to let you power your phone while you chow.  My tastebuds fell in love with their Aussie meatpies when I had a chance encounter with their booth at a Toronto Underground Market event many moons ago. And it's never been the same since whenever I look at pies.\r\n\r\nTheir savoury meat pies are the bees knees, to my taste buds and tummy. I don't know if it's crack or cocaine (or maybe both) that they add as a secret ingredient, but their pies are f^&%g delicious.  I always want MOAR!  It may make my gut a but softer, but whatever, that's why I lift heavy - to be able to to squeeze in a pie or two from Kanga :)\r\n\r\nThe owners, Erynn and Megan are absolutely delightful. I recall seeing their Kickstarter campaign and I immediately fell in love with their story, enthusiasm, their infectious smiles and adorable faux Australian accents.  I had the chance encounter with them at one of Propeller Coffee's Barista Latte Art Throwdowns over a beer. I have to say, they're just as delightful in person as they were on camera.\r\n\r\nOh, did I mention they serve some pretty dope coffee as well? They were trained by the folks behind Propeller Coffee who also own Crema Coffee, so their coffee is just as good if not better!\r\n\r\nBack to the pies.  While a bit pricy, you certainly get what you pay for as they're just the right size to hit the spot whether a snack or for lunch.  Now if only they opened up late so I can get a late night snack....  The pies are wonderful and the staff are courteous , a must try if your anywhere nearby.  Quick very friendly service this evening! She was very welcoming and made some suggestions after knowing it was our first time. \r\n\r\nButter Chix- Creamy subtle kick of butter chicken spice... Saucy very enjoyable!  \r\n\r\nMum's Chicken Pie - Classic  was not disappointed LOVE the touch of Chardonnay really gave it that extra little something \r\n\r\nTraditional Aussie - Saucey , meaty, has a little potato (not too much... Which I really appreciate because I didn't have an allergic reaction to it from that very reason ) \r\n\r\nSurprisingly even though these little guys are the size of your palm they are actually decently filling ! ... You might just need 2-4 to fill you up depending on how much you can handle. \r\n\r\nPrice is okay ... About $7 each Palm sized pie. They have 4 pies for $24 to take home and cook located in the freezer ( I feel that is a better suited price for the cooked ones too)   \r\n\r\nOn the plus size the hand held sizes lets you try more flavours!! \r\n\r\nWould recommend people to check it out!  I've never been motivated to write a yelp review ever before tonight, I had the kiwi\\/New Zealand whatever pie and it was amazing. It tastes even better than what you imagine eating looking at their sites pictures. \r\nLegit everyone needs to try this place.  A nice find!! Their coffees were good and the desserts better!! A little Aussie experience in Toronto... That's how we do!!  Super fresh and delicious. I've never had Australian meat pie before.... And I can say I am totally impressed! There flat white is also very delicious too :)  Deliciousness! Great "personal" sized pies and cute little store. Came here for lunch on weekday, short line but I ordered through an app beforehand so was able to pick up my order right when I got there.  Pie was nicely packaged up and was warm. I ordered the Aussie pie (~$6) and in my opinion was the perfect size for one. The crust was flaky which I love and the filling inside was delicious, not too salty as some savoury pies tend to be.\r\n\r\nWill be back to try other flavours and definitely recommend to those who have not tried it!  The meat pies are delicious, however they are too small. I just ate one for lunch and I'm still hungry. If I'm going to spend $8 on one meat pie I would hope I would at least feel satisfied afterwards. Tasty food but not worth the price in my opinion  Got a chance to taste three different pies with an Aussie friend of mine. I spent a month in Australia with her a few years ago, and we were both had the craving. Each was more delicious than the last! .. but Aussie pies they were not. Close, but no cigar.\r\nThey\'re similar, and very tasty, and they satisfy the craving.. but it\'s not the first time I\'ve heard "you just can\'t make them the same here". Something about the water perhaps. The particular brands or ingredients used. The change of taste in livestock from one continent to the next.. All factors that take this from \'just like home\' to a near miss.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the service was quick and friendly (non-Australia, but we won\'t hold them to that). The space itself is small, but it\'s not trying to be a restaurant and there is some seating along the window, and was clean. And most importantly, the food was delectable and fresh.  Absolutely yummy meat pies- $7 average for a pie and it's pretty filling. I tried both the creamy chicken And the kiwi. Definitely recommend this place  On food alone, definitely merits a 4 star, maybe even 5 star.\r\nHowever, I can't get over the price of these tasty little pies! I don't mind paying more for quality ingredients, especially when minced meat is a key ingredient. At $7-8 a pie these are quite expensive.  1 is more like a little appetizer, 2 is barely filling but buying 3 for one person is just excessive.\r\nI purchased 4 frozen pies (Kiwi Classic, Traditional, Canadian and Butter Chicken) and baked them at home. The Kiwi Classic was hands down the best one! My fiance and I did not care for the traditional - something about the gravy was off. I really liked the Canadian because there was lots of gravy although it was pretty salty (probably due to the bacon!). The butter chicken was okay - didn't really taste like butter chicken sauce though.\r\nAnyway, I'm glad I finally checked this place out but I can't say I'd return because for nearly $30 on a take out meal we were just not full. \r\nPS the buttery crust on the pies is SO good!!!!  Had the Traditional pie today. Nice balance of filling and ingredients to pastry. Good overall flavour, not overwhelming like some of the other places I've tried. Pastry good but not as flakey as the best.  All in all though a good pie!\r\n\r\nFriendly service, clean establishment. \r\n\r\nUpdate 09\\/2016 - over the past year have eaten here a few times and it's been consistently excellent. On my last visit they had a new pie - peppery steak.  Great flavour, huge chunks of beef, and the usual excellent flakey crust. Nice!  I had the original and it was good. It was sort of similar to a Jamaican patty. Tried a bite of the Canadian and I liked mine much more! I would have one again but I wouldn't go out of my way.  I've eaten here 4-5 times since they opened. First time was perfection (also with a grand opening price of just $5). I had the chicken pot pie and there was so much chicken and flavour. So delicious. \r\n\r\nOther visits began to disappoint for the reasons given in other reviews (value, cold filling, not much meat in the pie, still hungry after eating it). \r\n\r\nToday I had the chicken  pot pie and was tremendously disappointed. It wasn't until my final bites that I found a piece of chicken.  It was basically a sauce pie with a single small piece of chicken. Is it terrible of me to expect multiple pieces of chicken in my nearly $8 pie?\r\n\r\nI wanted to love this place. I tried, but I just can't.  I ordered the traditional and it was ok..nothing special.  It didn't have a lot of taste or spice. Probably wouldn't go again. Also quite expensive at $7 considering my husband and i were hungry again in 2 hrs  Love the boutique feeling and the friendly service at the counter. The pie is reminiscent of better quality fresh-made meat pies. Pastry is really fantastic. The beef is fresh and of good quality (yes, even with minced meat, it\'s possible to detect quality :).  \r\n\r\nTo those that would compare this with a Jamaican patty, I\'d say they are two different things entirely. The pastry here is of the fluffy phyllo variety, and the feeing is much heartier and has a homemade texture and taste. \r\n\r\nThat said, I had the urge to go instead to a particular restaurant on King St W (rhymes with Har Bop) that serves many local craft beers and makes meat pies in-house daily (rather than heated from frozen like Kanga) that taste like heaven. However those pies are double the price, double the calories (for sure) and take a long time to come to the table.  \r\n\r\nFor the quick, drop-in convenience and homemade-level quality (and the novelty) I\'d say these are worth a try... but honestly the traditional I had was a bit boring and predictable, and  oilier than I anticipated. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, ~8 dollars and 20 minutes later, I\'m still hungry after my "Traditional" pie. :\\/  Came here and got 2 pies. The Canadian and the traditional. The pies were of good quality, decent size for one person.\r\n\r\n3 stars since there's not many meat pie places to compare against and the food was on par. Not mind blowing, which is why I'm reluctant to give it 5 stars. I would give it 3.5 if possible.  The sad thing about this place isn't that I could grab the same types of pies for like a dollar back home and that the place is a rip off (seriously you can get this crap on any street corner dairy), but that the guys that work there put on a hardout aussie accent when no one fricken talks like that in Oz...  Been twice, enjoyed it twice. Handheld buttery flake pies of meat and gravy. Makes me happy every time.  Why aren't there more meat pie shops in the city?! This needs to happen. \r\n\r\nIf only Kanga had Sausage Rolls left...missed out both times. If they're anything like the Pie Commission Sausage Roll I may need to move West of Yonge.  Contacted Kaga to make a bunch of Lamingtons for a birthday party we were having for an Australian co-worker.  He and the entire office loved them.  Deliciousness of the dessert aside,  Megan was amazing to deal with when making arrangements.  She was prompt in her replies, very helpful and extremely personable.  \r\n\r\nThey gave the birthday boy a traditional Aussie pie and he said it was almost as good as his mum's!\r\n\r\nI totally recommend them!  I love these damn pies. Had them at a Yelp event & been in love with them ever since. Finally went to the Queen\\/Spadina area last week & made a trip just for 4 pies ($30 after tax!). IMHO, they are a bit expensive & it could be a little bigger. But they are so good it almost doesn't matter. \r\n\r\nMy fav is the creamy zucchini & traditional. Absolutely to die for! Tried making these on my own, but it is just not the same. Yummy buttery crust ^^ I hope they open up more locations up north! I would be there lining up almost everyday....\r\n\r\nThe shop is nice & there is a little area to sit down & finish it. I was greeted right away & the girl was telling me which was the most popular etc. But before she got into her speech I kinda cut her off & told her what I wanted lol She was so nice & also included a chart which helps identify the type of pie so you don't mix them up.  As others have already perfectly summed it up, the verdict is: tasty, but overpriced, pies!\r\n\r\nMine cost $9 with tax and to be honest, it wasn't even to fill me up! To buy two small pies will put you at $15-$20, and considering this is a small take out joint with only a couple stools, it's not really an affordable lunch option.\r\n\r\nI can't see them staying in business unless they fix up them prices!\r\n\r\nI did have a very delicious pie though - pulled pork with mashed potato on top :)  Passed by this place a couple of times and figured I would finally give it a try. I decided to get the 4 for $24 frozen pie deal (price is included in the tax) but there weren't a whole lot of selections available. I asked the lady at the cash if I can only select from what is in the fridge but she told me that you can pick your own combination of the four.\r\n\r\nAfter letting her know that it was my first time and asking for some recommendations, she told me a couple, like Traditional Aussie, Canadian, Butter Chix, Mum's Chicken Pea, and Creamy Zucchini. She also told me of this 'four fave' combo which includes most of the 5 I've mentioned.\r\n\r\nI ended up getting two Traditional, one Butter Chix, and one Creamy Zucchini. They got them out from the freezer in the floor below (through the employee only area), put them nicely in a small pizza box. The lady at the cashier explained about how they have this icon system so that you can tell which pie has which flavour.\r\n\r\nAfter I got home from about an hour and half of public transit and walking, the pies were still cold. The box came with instructions so I preheated a toaster oven at the suggested temperature and applied egg wash meanwhile. Half an egg would have been enough for all four pies but they're kind of hard to find in grocery stores. I baked them for about 40 minutes (considering the unavoidable thawing time) and they turned out to be quite soft. If you want to have it a bit crunchier you could try baking it for longer, or try using an actual oven. I did notice that one of the icons started dissolving into the crust.\r\n\r\nThey all tasted okay. Traditional tasted like salty gravy (not super salty), Butter Chix tasted like what you would expect from curry chicken, and Creamy Zucchini tasted like Alfredo pasta minus the pasta. And more zucchini. Considering the price of about $6.50 each (unless you get the four pie deal) about the size of the palm of your hand, the pies were alright. I wouldn't come here on regular basis.\r\n\r\nWhile the staff was friendly and helpful, the taste for that price is just okay. Maybe it would taste better if you get them fresh from the shop, or maybe the other ones taste better.  My pie was tasty but small. At $7.50 I left hungry and looking for another snack.  Yum. So much yum.\r\nThe pastry is what the pastry in your dreams tastes like -- so buttery, so flaky, and so perfectly brown and crispy. I have tried butter chicken and the classic australian beef and preferred the former. The fries with chicken salt were also pretty special, though I wouldn't make a special trip for them. \r\nAll in all I'm so glad I found this place! Go there and give it a try!  I really wanted to like this place. I REALLY did - I love meatpies.\r\n\r\nBut - Kanga just didn't do it for me. The filling itself was okay. The crust was (admittedly its a preference) just far too buttery and flakey. It felt more like I was just taking a bite out of a giant puff pastry with a bit of filling in the middle.  Tried to order with them on Uber. One of the worst experiences every.The restaurant cancelled my order after uber had charged my act.  All because the can't update there menu to what's in stock and what's not. \r\n30.00 now having to be returned to me by uber in the next 5-10 days. Great experience.  Thanks alot  Delicious pies, a bit pricey if you're super hungry. LOVE their cookies  As an Australian, I\'m so happy to have a meat pie place in downtown Toronto! Megan and Erynn, the young entrepreneurs of this restaurant, lived in Australia temporarily and fell in love with a food very dear to our hearts - our meat pies. \r\n\r\nIn Australia, meat pies are traditionally consumed as take-out food, topped with tomato sauce, and handheld while it is eaten out of a paper bag. At the Kanga\'s soft launch, this was exactly how I had my pie, and it just tasted like home. Pies are about more than just a tasty meal, they are a part of embracing the footy, the beach, and even a day at the shops. \r\n\r\nThere are several creative fillings available, and I do like the "Traditional Aussie" pie, with a vegemite-braised minced beef filling. I\'ve also heard great things about the vegetarian "Creamy Zucchini" from friends. The pastry is amazing, better than most pastry crusts you\'ll find in Australia. Pies are available straight from the oven for take-out, and frozen for preparation at home. One day, if I\'m brave enough, I\'ll try to Poutine my Pie.\r\n\r\nThese girls went on a long adventure in Australia seeking out the best pie places to learn from and hone their recipes. They are passionate about bringing this Aussie style of casual food to Toronto, and I\'m proud to showcase their pies as Australian cuisine.  I had a sudden urge to eat meat pies recently and decided to come here for lunch.  I gave the Butter Chix and Kiwi Classic pie a try. Both were delicious, although I preferred the Butter Chix pie more - chicken curry in a creamy tomato sauce! The Kiwi Classic pie contains minced beef filling with white cheddar cheese and has a stronger taste than the Butter Chix. It was recommended to eat with ketchup but I didn't feel the need to. The pastry was very buttery and flaky - quite delicious!\r\n\r\nMeant to be a takeout place, the seating area is quite small, with seating enough for six people. However it wasn't really busy when I went during lunch hour and could easily get a spot to sit.\r\n\r\nThe only downside to this place is that the pies are a bit on the pricey side for the portion you get. One pie will most likely not fill you up, especially for males and others who have a good appetite!  After reading a lot about this joint I was very excited to try it out. However, I didn't have the best experience. I asked for my food to go but when I got back to my office there were no utensils packed and not even a single napkin which was quite frustrating since this type of food has a lot of oil. The pie was very tasty but lukewarm temperature. It was also not as big or filling as I thought it would be and I was still hungry after. I wish I had ordered two but spending $12 on two small pies didn't seem worth it. I probably won't return here.  Oh god, words cannot express how extremely delighted and happy my tastebuds are after taking a bite out of the butter chix. I certainly couldn't help myself as I completely devoured the delicacy known as curry chicken in a fluffy pie crust and as I fell to temptation, I took a bite out of the minced beef pie and literally cried tears of joy. \r\n\r\nI bought the box of four for $24 and while that's venturing on the danger line, I'm going to tell you now that those few thousands of calories are totally worth it.\r\n\r\nI'm craving for that delicious moment when I'm finally able to introduce my tastebuds to the traditional Aussie meat pie.  I tried my first Kanga pie at TUM and have been obsessed ever since! I am so delighted that I can now buy a pie whenever my heart\\/stomach desires and not have to wait for the girls and their pies to return to TUM.\r\n\r\nThe pastry is always flakey, and you can truly tell that the filling is made from high quality ingredients. I serve these pies for breakfast, lunch and I have even warmed one up for myself as a midnight snack (shhhh). \r\n\r\nI have travelled to Australia before and eaten many pies, the Kanga ladies have created a fantastic gourmet Canadian interpretation of the Australian staple food!  3.5* \r\n\r\nKanga served as a perfect option for a quick pre-show snack on a weekend evening when most other Queen St. establishments in the area had a long lineup. \r\n\r\nThe service was fine for a quick takeout place and the person serving us took the time to explain what was inside each pie (probably for the umpteenth time that day)! The prices were alright as well and around what you would expect. I would say sharing 3 pies between 2 people would do the trick in terms of portions. \r\n\r\nAs for the pies themselves, I found the pepper-steak surprisingly flavourful and well balanced. The pie was fresh and the proportion of filling:pie was on point. On the other hand, I was not nearly as impressed with the butter chicken as I found the flavour a little overpowering. \r\n\r\nOverall, Kanga is probably your best bet for a delicious snack on an otherwise bland Queen W. block.  I didn't know Toronto had Australian pies, so I decided to give Kanga a go. It's a cozy shop with 5 or 6 seats. The service was indifferent. The woman at the counter seemed disinterested. The food was alright, but the pies were expensive for their size. It was about $7 a piece, and each pie was a bit larger than my fist. The pies were mildly warm, and not as hot as I liked. They should've been reheated before being served. The crust was flakey, but not the best I've had; but, there was a nice buttery taste. Between the Traditional Aussie, Kiwi, and Creamy Zucchini, I liked the creamy zucchini the best. Other than being creamy, there was a heavy pepper taste (black pepper lovers rejoice). I happened to be there when deliveries were being made, and it seems like the pies are not house made and are frozen (I may be wrong here). Regardless, Kanga is a neat place to go with a small group. There's also wireless charging for guests to use while they eat.  Tired their pies. Very delicious. I'm giving the 3 star just because the food was good quality. Very pricey for the quantity they provide. The pies are like really small. U ve to eat like 3 of them to just fill u up. One pie is like $7.50. I've had better quality n quantity for same price range.  Love the Pies but hate the fries. Either they put too much salt (chicken salt\\/regular) or not at all. And they changed from shoestring fries to the thicker ones. I prefer the shoestrings =]  small, quick serve lil joint\r\ndowntown, just off of queen street,\r\nwith five to six seats\r\n\r\ntradish aussie pie\r\nminced beef in a gravy with\r\na unique flavour\r\n\r\nseems like a blend of\r\nsubtle spices my palate\r\ncan't discern too well\r\n\r\ngod bless flaky crust\r\nthe way a good pie should be\r\ni'd have it again!\r\n\r\nimpressive menu\r\nboasting various options\r\nno kanga meat though\r\n\r\nlike a boomerang,\r\ni left right after i ate,\r\nbut i'll come back soon  I had the Butter Chix Pie combo with fries.  The food itself was good enough, and I would have it again.. but as is quite often the case you walk into a place offering the authentic thing and somehow its just not there.  It was more invoking the memory of Aussie meat pies rather then the real thing.  Down under I feel they are generally more "meat filled" and certainly cheaper so when I had less then that for 7$\\/throw you know how I would feel.  If a Jesters Pies opened up beside them they wouldn\'t stand a chance but it is a good effort without competition in the area.  I was really excited to try Kanga. Came here on Pi day and tried the Traditional and Canadian. All the pies are baked fresh which leaves less variety when busy. I really liked the Canadian and the chunks of beef were huge. I do think that the pies are overpriced for what it is, probably won't be coming back anytime soon because I'd rather get a bowl of pho for the same price.  Flaky, crispy hot meat pies. Have tried the Canadian, Creamy Zucchini, and El Diablo - all great choices! Love the heartiness of the Canadian, the mash potatoes that top the El Diablo\r\n\r\nDO try the lamingtons and pecan bar - they are so, so, so very good chilled!  The best pie I ever had and will ever have.\r\nDefinitely go for traditional taste.\r\nI regret that I only ate one piece of it. It seemed a bit big but it was multi thin layer of pie crust made it look big, so you can actually eat a lot of them!\r\nIf I visit Toronto again in near future, I must stop by to try other taste like Kiwi.  Going to have to pull out the British card and say Aussie pies do not compare. \r\n\r\nCame here before an event, with a friend who recommended the place. It was his treat so no complaints as we both got the combo meal. \r\nMy first thoughts were that the pies are titchy, i will need something more to eat after.\r\n\r\nChose the El Diablo with fries and a drink combo, and my first thoughts were definitely wrong as the pies are more filling that I imagined. \r\nThe El Diablo was the pulled pork one and it would have been nicer with some more kick in it. The top of the pie is a layer of potato mash. The fries were done fresh and came out nice and hot.\r\n\r\nOnly about 5 high stools to sit at by the windows so not an ideal eat in place.  Oh. My. God. I have never had anything so delicious!!!! Pulled pork def the best one. Steak is a close second. Pricing is very fair. They also offer coffee specialty drinks,, what more could u want? Hmm? The woman who works here is very kind and sweet, every time I'm here service is great. Great grab and go  bite on the run.  Overrated. It's a simple meat pie. No need to go deliberately for it.  Was a rainy day at the Toronto Urban Roots Festival, but on the plus side, had a tasty aussie meat pie! Pastry was super crispy and tasty. Fresh out of the oven too, but watch out the filling is really hot.\r\n\r\nI had the Canadian and my girlfriend had the Aussie... I liked the Canadian more. Had a chat with Megan, one of the owners, and she's really nice - definitely support these guys!  Was in the mood for savoury pies, and this establishment hit the spot! \r\n\r\nAfter reading the reviews we tried the traditional and the butter chix combos with both the spinach and the sausage half rolls (+fries and gravy) \r\n\r\nThe pies themselves were delicious and flaky.  I preferred the butter chicken (tasty and not spicy hot) while my husband liked the traditional more. The spinach roll was good, but I didn't love the taste of the sausage roll. \r\nFries were good, but I couldn't really taste the chicken salt (?) that was advertised. Gravy had a fancier wine taste which was a bit unexpected. \r\n\r\nAgree that the pies were on the smaller side and a tad pricey, but the combo filled us up just fine. \r\n\r\nTotally the place to go to if your in the mood for comfort meat pies!  Went there recently for lunch and ordered the el Diablo pie combo with fries. The pie itself was very good although quite small. What's interesting is that you get a massive amount of fries, more than enough for a lunch. Overall while I enjoyed the food, I feel it is a bit overpriced for what you get. $6 for a side salad at a casual lunch place is too much.  I gave Kanga another try, following my "only ok" experience when they first opened. They now have a lunch special with a pie and salad or fries, for around $11. It\'s still a bit expensive but roughly on par with lunch prices everywhere else. \r\n\r\nThe pies themselves are much better, with a thinner, flakier crust and a better filling to pastry ratio, in my opinion. I still haven\'t ventured from the traditional, but the pulled pork pie looks amazing and is next on my list. \r\n\r\nPlus points for offering frozen pies to take home and charging points for cellphones in the (small) sit down area. They also have a bench outside which is nice.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth a try if you\'re in the area!  We tried the minced meat pie, the chickpea pie, the peppered steak pie, the sausage roll, mushy peas and gravy. Got from uber eats. All the pies were amazing, very tasty. However we had ordered the butter chicken pie, but got chickpea pie instead and we ordered spinach feta roll and got sausage roll instead so half our order was incorrect. The gravy was not good, I wouldn't recommend it. It was little gelatinous lumps. The half sausage roll was burnt black and didn't taste good. The mushy peas were our least favourite part of the meal. It just tasted really, really bad. The colour was gray and the texture was off putting. I would definitely go back for the pies but will skip all the sides and add ons.  Came here to pick up a quartet of frozen meat pies for the weekend after having a full dinner at Pai (down the street on Duncan), but was so tempted by the warm goods in the display case that I gave in and also got a fresh order of piping hot chicken salt fries ($3.75, regular size box). The Porcelain Price, you are worth it. \r\n\r\nI've come here for lunch take-out or a quick snarf on the outside bench by their window, where in the past, I've chosen the butter chicken pies.  Or here, as they call it: Butter Chix.  The sweet way the pleasant blonde lady shop manager said it in her cute Aussie accent made it it even more appealing.  Buttuh chee-icks.  Cuuuute. \r\n\r\nHubs ate the traditional pie today and said it was OK.  Tasted like Vegemite to me, but the hubs could only feel the umami mouth-feel, the kind you get from tomato paste.  \r\n\r\nI'll probably eat the frozen Butter Chix soon, since we've already cracked an egg for the egg washed top (this is only if you decide to get them frozen - they will do this for you in-store if you're eating them that day).  It's less creamy than the way I usually my butter chicken, but I think it does make sense not to make it overly creamy when it's already surrounded by a pie pastry.  After that, I will go for the creamy zucchini. Then after that, I will eat the Kiwi pie.  Then after that....Kanga pies forever.  Yum! Delicious, flaky, buttery crust. Heaven. I tried their traditional, masala and butter chicken pies. Everything was really good! I wish their made dessert pies too. Great place to grab a few pies for a quick meal. I need apple pie please.  I got the El Diablo, the spinach roll, sausage roll as well as the meat lover's pack of 4 pies a couple weeks ago. The El Diablo was kinda weird tasting, not that any of the ingredients were bad but pulled pork + mashed potatoes was... Interesting.\r\n\r\nThe other four pies that I made at home were pretty good though, but for $6 a pop I think they're quite expensive. In summary, the pies are decent but not really worth the $6, maybe $5 at most. The rolls were alright as well, nothing exceptional but certainly not bad. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would've been nice if the store also baked the pies that you got in-store because when I got mine they, along with the rolls, were about room temperature (not even warm) and in comparison to the ones I made at home, the pies are so much better when they are piping hot.  The aroma when you walk in the door - it's like you've gone to warm buttery heaven!\r\n\r\nThe pies were truly delicious with buttery crusts and rich hot tasty fillings with a variety of flavours (and vegetarian options available!) which you can buy piping hot or frozen to cook at home.  The Aussie side salad was also a pleasant surprise with it's arugula, baby spinach, beets, goat cheese all in a yummy honey-balsamic dressing! \r\n\r\nIt was love at first bite! But the best part is that the owners Megan and Erynn are absolutely lovely to work with! We had a luncheon in the office today and they were very helpful in assisting me with ordering and the food was piping hot and ready on time for pick-up, and they were a huge hit with everyone! So just give them a bit of notice and they can easily handle larger orders (we're around 15 people)!\r\n\r\nFantastic food, awesome experience, we will definitely be ordering from them again!  I am so happy that there is an "authentic" Aussie meat pie in Canada! I miss the meat pies in Australia, especially when i lived there for 5 years since my childhood days.  Although the meat pies are very pricey, i think it was very worth the price because of the food and the way they made the pies from scratch.  The place is tucked in the corner near momofuku though, so im pretty sure people will have a hard time looking for the place. The inside of the store is very cute, it has the Aussie fast food place feeling, like i remember back then.  I will def go back to the place to try out other meat pie flavours they have.  I visited kanga for the first time today. I had the kiwi classic. While the pies are good, they are way overpriced for what you get. I paid just over $8 with tax for one meat pie which barely satisfied my hunger. For the same price I could have gotten a burrito which would have definitely filled me up. If the meat pies were priced around $5-$6, I would have given them 4 stars but price-value only warranted 3 stars.  I love Kanga for a quick meal.  It's definitely a comfort food option, though.  They have a great range of pies, but it's just pies and french fries.  If you're not in the mood for a heavy meal then you have to go elsewhere.  Best meat pies ever! Layers n layers of flaky delicious tummy happiness.\r\nI had the kiwi pie which is beef n white cheddar.  My Kanga meal delivered today was the best ever! I'd never experienced your cuisine (or delivery) before. The pie was delicious, the french fries outstanding, and the salad entirely perfect (not to mention generous). Delivery was prompt and the food arrived in perfect condition.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was like eating in Australia itself!\r\n\r\nI shall be eating your meals frequently in future.  Delicious pie! Got minced meat and was too minced for my liking (felt like could be those frozen dinner things).  I would love to try others though.  The butter chicken was highly recommended.  This is an easy takeout spot.\r\nThe pie came in a small ghetto paper brown bag. So be careful not to get it too soggy.\r\n\r\nlocation is decent as it is on queen st.  Great job guys......really liked the crust and filling.  I guess there's not much else to eat but next time I'm around I'll be stopping by!  Had the Kiwi Classic - very nice crust and easily edible with your hands. Can't wait to try their other pies.  Excellent savory pies.  I had the Peppery Beef pie - very savory with a great pleasant peppery finished.  My wife liked the Spinach and Feta roll - the best she's had .\r\n\r\nMy son's enjoyed the Classic and the Butter Chix - Indian Butter Chicken.\r\n\r\nGood filling snack  As a pie expert (I\'m not really, but apparently anyone who can hold a fork is considered a "foodie" these days, so I am a pie expert), SO, as a pie expert I decided to try it out. \r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this little unassuming "Aussie" pie place while wandering around hunting for food at 3 in the morning, so I quickly pulled out my trusty phone and bookmarked it for a later date.  Three months later, here I am! The space is small and cozy with only two counter top bench tables to sit at, maximum seating is about 7 people.  The table benches were white and strewn with memories of previous happy pie eaters.  I assumed this was on purpose, because I was there for about 20 minutes, no one else entered, but the one staff member never cleared off these memories, what else could it be right?\r\n\r\nI ordered one Traditional Aussie pie and a Mum\'s Chicken Pie.  The crusts had a flavor deliciously buttery and golden, but it wasn\'t flaky, which being a pie expert, I would expect in a golden pie crust.  It was slightly tough and chewy and the bottom of the crust had a similar consistency and taste to that of those frozen Swanson pies.  I struggled a little to tear apart the top with my hands.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the Traditional Aussie was minced beef in a rich beef gravy, with a hint of vegemite.  The Chicken pot pie had, well, chicken with a splash of Australian Pinot Grigio from Mallee Rock vineyards.  If anything, I found the pies here delightfully flavorful if not a little bit on the salty side though.  I\'m not sure why, but the Traditional Aussie pie had a strong overtone of cheddar cheese, which I found a little bit offensive and overpowering.  The chicken pie had nice generous chunks of chicken drowning in delicious creamy sauce.\r\n\r\nAt $6.95 a pie, it was decently affordable given the size.  They have many more varieties of pies available and different combo options, perhaps worth a try next time I come around.  What else is there to say about them? They\'re pies, pies are yummy, go try it!  I got the creamy zucchini and mates masala are so good. i've been craving it for days.  So much flavours. You cannot have too much of them. I almost said yummy, these pies almost make me a foodie...almost  I picked up the 4 pack of frozen pies (24$) which included the traditional, creamy zucchini, butter chicken, and the Canadian (steak and bacon). \r\n\r\nMy fav was the butter chicken and the traditional meat pie. The crust on the pies is divine - they definitely use real butter.  I liked the cream zucchini the least, the flavour is just not there. The Canadian was so-so but don't think I'd have it again. \r\n\r\nIt's a little joint just south of Queen on Duncan Street. The service was fantastic! I didn't get the girl's name but she was very attentive even though she was preparing three coffee orders. \r\n\r\nI would definitely go back and pick up a bunch of the butter chicken pies. It's so easy to prepare when you just don't feel like cooking, or you have company over.  Kanga has quickly turned into the perfect lunch mainstay when you're craving something comforting and delicious with that close-to-homemade quality. The pastry is light and fluffy, the fillings are rich. I've tried several of the varieties and the butter chicken is my favourite thus far. Beware, though, because it WILL splorch on your pants and you WILL smell delicious all day. \r\n\r\nI have to say that I do appreciate the attention to detail and the little designs in the pastry top of the pies, but the pies themselves could be a little bigger. One pie seems to be not quite enough, while two pies is definitely too much! Price point could be a little lower, as well, as $9 including tax for one small pie is a bit much.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the pies are delicious, the staff are friendly, and the coffee's strong, so I'll be back.  Aussie meat pie kinda place ... not too far from union station, Queen West area. Small with a few seats. \r\n\r\nFor about $7-$8 you get a big-ish fist size (I have small hands) meat pie made quite uniquely. It's good, filling and comes nice and hot. Although for that price you can get more in portion elsewhere but if you're in the area I'd say still give them a try.\r\n\r\nThey have the following pies:\r\n\r\nTraditional Aussie (minced beef with gravy), Kiwi Classic (minced beef with white cheddar), The Canadian (steak and bacon), Butter Chix (chicken curry in tomato sauce), Mum's Chicken Pie (chicken pot pie), Creamy Zucchini (zucchini and caramel with onion, garlic and cream cheese), El Diablo (pulled pork filling and mash potato top), Mates Masala Pie (Indian chickpea curry with egg plant and sweet potato) and Brekkie Pie (tomatoes, bacon, eggs and cheddar cheese). \r\n\r\nThey also have Sausage Rolls and Spinach Rolls.\r\n\r\nThey sell frozen pies in boxes too (4\\/ $24). Some boxes consist of one flavour and others have a variety. If you buy in box I calculated a bit cheaper than getting an individual one there.\r\n\r\nNo I did not see any kangaroo meat pies or any kind of delicacy with that kinda meat but it's not bad for what it is. Apparently they're famous for their coffees too but I didn't get to try so can't comment on that...\r\n\r\nAnd if you're still not full after a pie, there's also a sawarma place next door!\r\n\r\nOh AND because you know I enjoy my alcoholic beverages .. they also suggest certain wine (Shiraz and Chardonnay) to go with your pies too!\r\n\r\nOh AND they have wireless charge spots on the tables.  Discovered this place was here while walking to Scotiabank Theatre to see Gone Girl. In the spirit of the film, I came back afterward to make a pie disappear (into my stomach).\r\n\r\nI ordered the Creamy Zucchini, seeing as 1) I already knew it would be delicious based on my previous sampling at a Yelp event and 2) it was the only vegetarian option. Boo. But as I always occasionally say, if you\'re only going to have one veggie dish, make sure it\'s damn good. Which Kanga certainly does.\r\n\r\nI hovered between 3 and 4 stars for a while because, as noted to death by virtually every single review, these tasty little tarts are overpriced by a couple dollars. We\'ll make it 3.5 stars with a "must try at least once" flag. I obviously can\'t vouch for the quality of any other pies on the menu, but the zucchini is a winner.\r\n\r\nI\'d also be more likely to return for ONE more different non-meat pie. How about an Aussie smoked fish pie? If you\'re reading this, Kanga, you\'re welcome to take my idea in exchange for calling it the Ell "Sea".  Never even heard of this place which isn't surprising but it was very tasty. I had the original pie with fries that were made fresh just for me. The fries had a chicken seasoning and it was delicious. The pie crust and filling were great not too salty but very flaky. The girls were so helpful and nice for accommodating all my inquiries. Definitely a must try.  I grew up in Sydney, but haven't had a meat pie in over a decade, since I left Aus. \r\n\r\nBut these don't quite live up to what I expected. The crust was decent. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the filling of the Aussie pie (I think because of the Vegimite gravy). I've NEVER had a pie with vegemite gravy in Aus! \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to make an option with more traditional gravy. And also have the option to put more gravy so it better resembles a true Aussie pie. \r\n\r\nI do think its overpriced too... just under $7 after tax, and I could easily eat 2 of these (although I just heard from a mate that pies in Sydney are now $5-$6).  Disappointed. My husband and I had high expectation of this place after reading the great reviews. We went over the weekend at the end of day ~6:30. There were only 5-6 pies left so very limited selection. Maybe its end of day, the pies were dry and way too salty for our taste buds.  I was incredibly excited to try Kanga, and I give it a two star for it's decent customer service and eye-catching storefront, but everything else was lackluster. I couldn't agree more with the reviews calling it underwhelming; it certainly was. I love flavourful food, so biting into an Aussie pie (I had the traditional) which was lukewarm, bland, and incredibly overpriced was disappointing. If the pie was small and it had been good, I wouldn't have minded, but it was small and bland and just not memorable at all. I really wanted to like this place, but don't see myself coming back!  I saw that kind of pies in australians' tv shows and reminded me my trip in Australia.\r\nI've tried TRADITIONAL AUSSIE and CANADIAN. Flaky pastries, good gravy. Perfect, a little bit expensive but so good.  Came here at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night, just before they closed at 9pm. I got the chicken pot pie (~$7) and it was so delicious! The pastry is buttery, rich and flaky and the filling is comforting and creamy. I just wished there was more of it because it only took a few bites to devour it. \r\n\r\nI\'d come back for the pies once in a while--the food is dynamite--however, the service I got on that particular day wasn\'t very welcoming. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I walked out, the lady behind the counter only spoke to me when I paid (she asked if it was only the pies that I wanted). No greeting, no "Can I help you?", no thank you, no warmth. \r\n\r\nI was also disappointed in the fact that they don\'t label the pies when they pack it for you. I had bought a couple different pies and they all look the same and I didn\'t want to cut into them because I was giving some away.  I've walked past this place a few times and decided to treat myself for lunch. I chose the $10 kanga box which featured a small basic salad (mixed greens & light balsamic dressing), a choice of a mini roll (I chose spinach & feta) and a Butter Chix pie.\r\n\r\nTo start, I think the value for the lunch special is comparable with other offerings. I've also tried other businesses lunch offerings which come in around the same price, and the value was there.\r\n\r\nThe salad was fine and got the job done. The spinach roll was delicious... I'd actually go out of my way to go back and get a full size. The pastry was super flaky and the seasoning was balanced. The butter chix pie was flavourful and delicious. It had a good amount of filling and the flavours were spot on.\r\n\r\nThis is a very small location with a handful of seats so it's best to go for takeout. Service was friendly and efficient.  I ordered The Canadian pie.  Came to $7.85 with tax.   The pie was so tiny you can literally finish it after a couple bites.  There is barely any meat inside, its mostly gravy.  I definitely recommend going to The Pie Commission for a way way better meat pie that will actually fill your belly.  I went to university in Melbourne and ate my share of countless amounts of sausage rolls. So when I heard about Kanga, I definitely had to try it out! Unfortunately the sausage roll of extremely dry and overly salty which was very disappointing. I won't be back and will wait till I'm in Australia again to get an authentic roll.  Deeelicious!  Kanga offers a variety of hand pies and sides, and I have to say, everything was yummy. The staff were friendly, helpful, and accomodating.\r\n\r\nBetween 4 of us, we had The Kiwi Classic, The traditional Aussie, and the Canadian hand pies.  All were so good, we're plotting our return.  We had fries and the Aussie salad (greens, shredded beets, goat cheese, and nuts (we're nut free and they were happy to leave them off).  \r\n\r\nThe only thing missing was seating. They have a counter that seats 5, and lucky for us, no one else was there.  \r\n\r\nPlease come to Boston--we'd love to eat at Kanga at home!  Pies are $7 but they're small, smaller than your palm.\r\nPie shell was delicious (claimed to be all butter and I don't doubt it).\r\nAt $7 and being small, I expected it to be stuffed with filling - like when you bite it, filling should be oozing out. Nope. It was half empty.\r\nI scooped out the filling and you couldn't make a mcd hamburger patty out of the meat from there. Should have taken the photo.\r\nI suspect the location and running the oven drive up the cost, which result in mediocre pies.\r\nSavoury pies are good alternative to all the fast food, burrito, shawarma places but I don't recommend this for a lunch. Shame.  My favourite place to get little pies!\r\n\r\nMy go-to flavour is the creamy zucchini and the steak and mushrooms is a close runner up. As a reviewer noted below, the creamy zucchini is peppery and it may strike some as a bit too spicy however, I love it. I usually get these pies frozen for those days where I am too lazy to cook dinner. \r\n\r\nThey are surprisingly very filling for such little delights! The crust is very flakey and buttery. I would recommend leaving them in the oven for a couple more minutes than the recommended cooking time to further brown the crust if you get them frozen.\r\n\r\nWould recommend the sausage rolls and the coffee as well!  Great spot for picking up lunch for those working in the area. Shared three pies between me and a co-worker: the Aussie classic, El Diablo and Chicken pie.  The aussie classic was my favorite. You can never go wrong with minced meat with gravy and there's something extra comforting about this classic combo.  The El Diablo was alright. It's like a shepherd's pie with pulled pork which was an interesting twist. We both thought the pie crust were excellent. Nice and flaky.  Price is reasonable for what you get.  Came in on a weekday around 5 and it was pretty empty. I ordered the Traditional meat pie and salad combo with drip coffee. I was happy with the texture and taste of the pastry part of the pie. It was flaky and buttery and delicious the meat filling was savoury and meaty! I also really enjoyed the salad which included spinach, grated beet root, candied pecans, goat cheese and a lovely honey dijon mustard dressing. It was so delicious that i ended up ordering a box of 4 frozen meat pies to go. It's $6 each, whereas it would normally be $6.95 each if you get it heated up there. I would definitely come here again the workers there were really nice and answered any questions that I had and I love the Australian accent  I thought the pies were just 'OK' based on the cost. I would give it 4 stars if it were cheaper but for the price the quality and taste was not out of this world.I had the butter chicken and classic beef. To be honest i think Pie Commission is the better place for pies.  Took a 4 pack home of the frozen pies. Butter chicken, and the veggie. These are crazy good. Like I wanna eat one every day good. Pastry is flaky and the pie is packed with fresh ingredients. Love love love this place.  I got the frozen pies, and when I baked them up at home, the pastry puffed up all light and flaky, with the filling all perfect inside. Some of the other reviews didn't find the filling all that special, and the main Aussie filling is largely ground beef + sauce + Vegemite, which might be nothing special for most people. I thought it was tasty, for what it was. \r\n\r\nI also tried the Kiwi pie and the pulled pork pie, but the butter chicken was the most memorable :)  I would eat that tasty butter chicken filling on its own, but it works really well in the flaky pastry.  It was, how do you say... underwhelming. Having gone to the GTA's other major meat pie places I have saved my visit to Kanga for last, and it flopped mostly because of the filling. \r\n\r\nI ordered the Canadian which was described as a steak pie made with ale gravy, which I usually get over the mince filling. Maybe that was my mistake, but the pie hardly had any steak in it! I tasted some small bits of meat with gristle, but steak it was not. The saving grace was that the gravy was at least delicious, but I would have preferred the meat portions found in almost all the other pie places over this. \r\n\r\nAt $7.25 plus tax, it wasn't cheap compared to its competition either, but I'll give it a pass for that given its downtown location. The small pie size didn't help either, nor does the fact that the top of the crust, though flaky and delicious, frequently fell out of place when biting into it, allowing the copious amounts of gravy to drip everywhere. None of this was a problem with the other pie places I've been to. \r\n\r\nThere were some good spots to the experience but I can't recommend this place when the competition like Wisey's and Pie Commission has stepped up their game so much.  I get lunch from them sometimes........a pie, half a roll and potatoes. Nice and filling. I do wish the pies were more spicy.  Pro: Pies are delicious.  \r\nI bought Aussie Traditional and Kiwi Classic. I like the Aussie Traditional more but they are both very delicious. Now I kindda want more! \r\n\r\nCons: I didn't care for the staff much. He was being a joker and forgot about our order. Also, I wished he would label which pie was which because I had to refer to yelpers pictures to figure it out.  Very little meat in the pie. I was mostly just eating pastry. I lived in Australia and ate tons of pies when I was there. Kanga unfortunately falls way short of what I was hoping for.  Tried the Australian traditional combo along with spinach roll and a Aussie salad. I had several Aussie pies when I visited Australia. Kanga tastes nothing like those. In fact, I can't distinguish their pies from just any ordinary meat pie from just about anywhere. Not terrible, but really nothing special. I think maybe even below average in terms of meat pies in general.  Only ever had the frozen meat pies from the grocery store so was very happy to try the real deal.\r\n\r\nThese pies are stuffed with meat and veggies and has an amazing crispy top. I'd recommend Kanga more for a quick bite or a snack rather than a meal. The pies are $7 which I'd like to see a little cheaper seeing it's not a full meal more of a snack.\r\n\r\nMy favorite pie were traditional (beef) and El Diablo (pulled pork)  We bought a batch of frozen pies from Kanga - and we ate them slowly and tried different kinds. My favorite was the traditional, although I found the creamy zucchini spicy (I'm spice intolerant). Regardless I really enjoyed these pies and would recommend them!! Very warm and comforting to eat!  This takes me back to when I was in primary school and the school tuck shop had these delicious sausage rolls and hot british meat pies. So satisfying.\r\n\r\nI personally wish you could taste the marmite more but overall delicious and really hit the spot.  so i decided to give this place a try after walking past it so many times and reading so many good reviews on it. \r\n\r\nfirst of all, it was quite expensive for the size they give you. like around $8-10 is pretty ridiculous. it's smaller than the size of my face ok.\r\n\r\nsecond, the taste was alright. i had such high hopes and it didn't taste like how i would imagine it to taste like. i would rather walk down to owl of Minerva down on spadina then to eat this. i could get a pork bone soup for around that much. honestly.  The original meat pie was a good size and the filling was savoury. However, the pie was luke warm at best. I also know that some people prefer eating the pie with their hands, but I wished they had knives available for those of us who don't want to roll up our sleeves. The fries and coffee that came with the combo were mediocre. I would have given two stars if not for the friendly servers who worked there. As mentioned before, it is a tiny store with limited seating, so I would recommend taking out your pie (and maybe pop it in the microwave before you eat it)!  I had the opportunity to try out kanga pies at a recent yelp event, and I was very impressed. The classic meat pie was delicious, perfectly seasoned and was generous in the gravy (which I love). The creamy zucchini was also fantastic and as someone who generally needs to have meat in everything to be satisfied, I was very impressed with the full flavour of the meatless pie. \r\n\r\nI can't wait to check out the shop and try more!  I had a chance to sample Kanga's traditional aussie meat pie at a recent Yelp event and it was fantastic! It was definitely the highlight of the event. The buttery flakey crust (and I love anything with a good crust) was filled with the perfect blend of beef, tomato and vegemite gravy (and yes I had it with ketchup :)... I can't wait to try the full sized one at their storefront location very, very soon! #eatkanga ftw!  I recently found out that Kanga had finally opened their own shop. I first tried Kanga meat pies last year at a food festival, and instantly fell in love with their pies!!\r\n\r\nEverything tasted amazing. The pie crust was nice and flaky, and all the fillings were full of flavour!\r\n\r\nTo read more about what I though about Kanga, check out my blog http:\\/\\/barbellsnbistros.blogspot.ca  I first tried Kanga Aussie pie at a night market event and from then on I cannot forget about that delightful meaty texture and flavor (extra points added due to I am a meat person)\r\n\r\nExcited walking in this small shop, there were at most 8 high chairs available to sit inside the shop, and 2 benches outside for summer time overlooking the street. Bought the traditional aussie pie $7 and got a plate & knife, sit down.\r\n\r\nIt was served hot which makes it even more tasty. Pastry is buttery and flaky. When I cut it in half, the minced beef and sauce (gravy) comes right out. The filling is not too salty, moist enough, and the amount of it was enough for me to share with another person as a snack.\r\n\r\nI understand why people are complaining about the high prices of the pies ($7-$8) for the look of it ie the size. However, I can promise you, you will not regret trying the pies in this place. It is a good pie overall with a variety of pies to choose from. Next time, I will be trying chicken pie\\/the canadian pie (steak and bacon)\r\n\r\nFriendly service, and clean environment. Stop by for a bite when you are tired from shopping on Queen street.  I was first introduced to meat pies when I worked in central Toronto.\xc2\xa0 I was located next to a New Zealand meat pie shop and boy were their pies juicy, hot gems.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, I was an eager beaver to try Kanga's Australian pies. I had seen the smaller kiosk shops in the underground pathway of the downtown core.\xc2\xa0 My initial thought was that they have great marketing collateral, particularly with their little postcard sized guide about all their pie varieties. Unfortunately, the marketing collateral was all that I found to be positively quirky.\xc2\xa0 I tried the kiwi pie, which was recommended by both the clerk as well as\xc2\xa0 Yelpers. The kiwi pie is the cousin of the Traditional Pie but with cheese inside to give it an extra kick.\xc2\xa0 This kick wasn't really a kick though because I barely tasted any cheesiness in most of my bites and instead had mouthfuls of just minced beef and gravy.\xc2\xa0 Of course, by all means the beef and gravy had a great flavour, but the pie leaves you with a greasy after-taste that can make your stomach churn if you're not used to frequently ingesting heavy and fattening foods.\xc2\xa0 My other coworker also noted that the crust was average and was nothing to take home about, as it was similar to crusts he gets at the supermarket.\xc2\xa0 Speaking of supermarkets, I think I would prefer warming up a pie from the local grocery store rather than going to Kanga.\xc2\xa0 At least I would get double to triple the amount of pie there for the 7 dollars you pay at Kanga, where you would get a measly pie that's the size of a large palm.\xc2\xa0 The way its pricing system is laid out, it makes it hard to believe that its stamp system works as an efficient incentive.\xc2\xa0 You get a free pie after paying around $80 for pies?\xc2\xa0 Maybe there are some hardcore meat pie enthusiasts out there, but I'm just not one.  Had the traditional meat-pie, YUM!! I have no idea what Vegemite is but is amazing. The crust on the pies are really tender and flaky definitely a great snack for a hanger over cure!\r\n\r\nOnly bad thing were the fries, they had way too much salt, easy fix and I guess they're known for the meat-pies so you can't blame them too much.  Good Australian style pies.  Great service but a bit pricy to eat at daily.  Desserts are a nice treat.  Love the pies here!! I always get the lunch special - a regular meat pie, a little side pie and a salad.  For $10 it's a pretty tasty lunch. I could definitely eat 2 of the main pies though. My favourite is the butter chix.  Just had a lunch for $15 which included a butter chicken pie, Aussie Salad and coffee. All were so tasty! The pie was filling and full of flavor, the salad is made fresh with a light flavor dressing, goat chs, roasted nuts and cranberries with a beautiful medium roast coffee. Cool spot for a quick lunch just off queen.  If I could eat one hand-held food for the rest of my life, it would without a doubt be Kangas pies. I have been following them like a crazy foodie stalker since they launched at the Toronto Underground Market and I tasted their Aussie-inspired beef pie. Since then, they've upped their game, coming out with a whole line of savoury pies- some with meat and some with veg. My favourite still remains the classic Aussie pie though-gah, I'm having a wicked craving right now as we speak. The flaky tender crust, the rich meaty filling, all topped off with a good squirt of ketchup. \r\nSome may think they're expensive, but if you compare it to a lot of downtown restaurants its a very reasonable option- even a lot of food trucks food is a lot more expensive. If you're comparing it to fast food, well, then I can't really help you.Personally, I would rather pay for a quality hand-made product than an  fast food factory-farmed meal but that's just me. When something is so satisfying, you don't need an excessive amount. \r\n\r\nHighly recommend it.  We are here on Saturday afternoon.  It's now Monday morning and I am dreaming of the Butter Chix pie that I ate.  My god, was it good.  I am currently debating paying an international shipping fee to experience the goodness again.  Oh man, I love me some meat pies. My husband and I were visiting Toronto for the weekend and were killing time downtown before heading to the Tragically Hip concert when we decided that getting a couple of meat pies would be a wonderfully delicious way to spend some time. \r\n\r\nWe chose the Australian and the Butterchix and each had half. They were both excellent, but the Butterchix was absolutely the star of the show. Like, so good that I need to learn how to make it because they don't have anything as good anywhere near me. \r\n\r\nService was very friendly, and they have a nice variety of bottled drinks in the little place, and also have frozen ones available to take home. I feel like if this place was by where I lived, I'd have a problem.  The whole store smells great. I missed kiwi pie so much, has to try it. The kiwi one tasted good, but definitely not for someone on diet. \r\nThe pastry is not quite right as I remembered. Too crispy, don't get me wrong, it tastes good, just not exactly a Australian\\/Kiwi style.  \r\nWill come again for sure  Hey fellow nerds. Today, 3\\/14th is Pi day 3.1415920 so get your nerd on and eat plenty of pies pies pies. \r\nKanga\'s pies are so buttery, so flaky, and so good. Go there early to get best of selections. These are savory pies. And one pie is very filling. I usually get the "creamy zucchini" or "steak and mushroom". Small establishment. Most guests take it to go.  I happen to run into  this place after an afternoon at the four seasons center for ballet. We were hungry and looking for a place to eat and it seemed great, the pies looked beautiful and we decided to give it a try. The place was kind of small but cozy. The pies tasted great but it was a bit on the pricy side ($8).  Reserving final review for now, but: so far, the traditional pie, with ketchup, was divine. I suppose it could have used more filling. The sausage roll? Ummm...I like a traditional SR, and this was not it. Pass. Verdict? I can't wait to go back at lunchtime for more meaty pies!  Australian meat pies. Had the original which was fairly tasty, but my only knock on it is that it comes out lukewarm, which is a bit disappointing. I think it would taste better if it was a bit hotter. \r\n\r\nNot really sure how they're made. They ran out of the butter chicken pie and said they won't expect another shipment for a few days, which makes me wonder how they're made and how long they sit there before I order one. \r\n\r\nThe fries are pretty flavorful. The chicken salt is very tasty, but the fries aren't crisp and some of the fries are a bit droopy.  Soft opening today, grand opening tomorrow (Friday, May 23rd).\r\n\r\nAustralian meat pies; some with a twist.  There's a good variety of fillings so definitely something for everyone.  \r\n\r\nFlakey, buttery, and quite delicious!  Served piping hot so don't burn yourself on your first bite!\r\n\r\nI think their prices are a tad expensive for the size of the pie, but it's still worth a taste.  I was in the queen west neighbourhood and following the raving reviews from my fellow yelper's I had to make a quick stop in here. \r\n\r\nCame here during the lunch hour and picked up a Traditional Assie - minced beef in a rich beef gravy with a hint of vegemite. Costs averaged around ~$7 - $8 a pie depending on which pie you select. The pies are all made with 100% pure butter pastry and local, responsibly-raised meat. The pies are about a large fist size. For bigger eaters, you may want to opt to combo your meal with a side salad or fries. \r\n\r\nThe pie was really rich and tasty, and kept me satisfied for the next hour. Would have liked if there was more meaty goodness stuffed in the pie. \r\n\r\nTime: It took about 15 mins from entry to the time I could leave the store armed with my decadently scented pie. There were two others in line before me. The store is a petite gem and on this day there was only one staff. She was fantastic at holding down the kitchen and cash, however it was clear the shop was understaffed. \r\n\r\nProtip: arm yourself with a handful of napkins if you're going to eat the pie on the go. The buttery goodness may find a way of spreading all over your face and hands. \r\n\r\nCheck out these pies if you're already in the area. G'day mate.  Walked by and saw a sign indicating "damn good coffee". I had to take them up on the challenge. Ordered a "Cortado"... and DAMN - it was good.  Their Pies - Kiwi, Mama, and Butter Chix were extremely flakey, greasy, super flavourful and my kids (3 and 5 year olds) liked them which is a huge selling point.  Location\\/Service\r\nIt's along Queen Street (pass University Ave), but on a smaller side street. The place won't be hard to miss as the exterior is very colorful\\/vibrant, a beach day Aussie feeling. It's a small restaurant with a few bar table seating available - it's more for a come-and-go kinda style. Interestingly, there's a wireless charging available by the table - if you are planning to sit down, remember to charge your phone (iphone + android available)!\r\n\r\nFood\r\nI came at around 7-ish, so most of their products are sold-out. Had the opportunity to try Mum's Chicken Pie and Pepper Steak Pie. Perhaps it was almost closing time, the food may have been sitting out for a little while. So I did find the chicken a little dry and the steak a little rough to chew on. Nonetheless, the pie crust was very crisp. \r\n\r\nPortion wise, one pie definitely won't fill you up as a meal. I shared this with a few friends, so it was a light quick snack. The staff on duty gave us a few complimentary spinach+feta rolls - those were actually pretty tasty as it was still fresh and had a strong flavor of both spinach and feta (i.e. not just a plain pastry).\r\n\r\nI would like to come back again when there are more to choose from, also like how there's a lot of different unique cuisines around the area!  A tiny restaurant that has a pretty big punch. I tried the traditional pie and It's pretty much the size of your hand! It's piping hot right out of the oven. My friend's pie got stuck to the aluminum so it pretty much ruined the entire pie and he had to eat it with a fork. I also got a coffee with my order and I suggest you do the same. Coffee was so good that I had to ask what it was. They showed me coffee grinds from Guatemala; definitely worth getting. \r\n\r\nOverall, a good joint to get a quick bite to eat and be in and out within 15 minutes!  Holy Moses, my girlfriend and I were blown away by Kanga Australian Pies.\r\n\r\nThese signature Pies that they due are made with love. Blasting your taste buds with flavor. Real close to queen st, is always a great idea, to cut in, and grab yourself a pie.\r\n\r\nWe had the Canadian, and the auzzie. Amazing. A great discovery, right around the corner from the Rex and the friendly stranger.\r\n\r\nI will be recommending this to my friends, and I will be going back for sure.  $7.50 later, im left still hungry. Don't get me wrong, it's great commercial meat pie (ie buttery). But to me this is a substitute for a beef patty which costs about $1.80. \r\n\r\nOverpriced but quick, so I sometimes get it and immediately regret it after I finish eating it (which is about 5 mins because it's tiny).\r\n\r\nAnd just FYI, girls think the pie is small and unfilling too. \r\n\r\n2.5 stars out of 5 \r\n\r\nJimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:\r\n[*] Disappointing. Just...no. \r\n[**] Not very good. Will not return. \r\n[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. \r\n[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. \r\n[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time.  I popped in for a quick snack. I had the zucchini pie and it was amazing\r\n So garlicky and the pastry was flaky and buttery. I tried a bite of my friends sausage roll and it also was yummy. The sausage was spiced nicely and the same flaky crust was around it. A great snack!  It's a little pricey, but very well executed. We sampled three for dinner between two of us and both the butter chicken and creamy zucchini were nom nom nom. An excellent place for a quick tourist meal.  I really wanted to like these because this store is so close to where I live. However, when compared to a certain other pie shop in Toronto, these pies are mediocre at best.  I walk past kanga everyday and finally rewarded myself with a visit after a stressful day. Being a kiwi i had to get the kiwi classic mince and cheese pie. The pastry top is beautifully flaky but the base I thought a bit thick. Filling was yummy and even had the cheese sticking to the top. Not quite the same as a Georgie pie (my barometer of an awesome pie) but it was tasty and hit the spot.  As previous yelpers have mentioned it is quite exxy for the price $8. The service is lovely.  I was soooo excited when we found this place, after a recent trip to Australia I had been craving a decent meat pie, but alas! They are no where to be found in Boston. These meat pies are a little different, pretty much more upscale versions of the ones found at every bakery in AU. They were phenomenal, flaky crust, top notch ingredients, and a wide selection for every taste.  Needless to say I will make a stop or two here on any visit to Montreal!  Ta Pies had high expectations from me. I think that really affected my view of it. I expected authentic, flavorful butter chicken in their butter chicken pie, but I should've known that it's very hard to do butter chicken right. I liked the classic steak pie better, but I will go back to try their other varieties as I'm sure they've got more to offer.  Great place for authentic Australian pies!!! Deff recommend you try this place if you're looking for something new... Do it!!!  First time having Australian pie like a few Yelpers here. The small $6 butter chicken patty was a crispy, layered, and creamy package, very enjoyable. Mild flavors and not too salty, the way i like it. There are a few Tabasco and srirachas to choose from, but I chose to have mine plain.  We had the spinach, mushroom, tomato and ricotta pie, which looked like the only meatless pie they had that day (it was our last day in Montreal, and we were cramming our morning fulfilling our munchies on all kinds of fatty goods, so, we decided to go light. I would've loved to try the curry meat pie though). It is pretty good; I like it with ketchup on top, but they have other condiments on the side for you before you sit down in one of their high chairs (there are only a couple tables). It's cute how they are like a mini emporium of authentic Australian foods.  Nice little restaurant. Can't really comment on how Aussie they really are, since I've never even been to Australia, but the pie was tasty. Sold cold, warm or frozen for take home.  I lived in New Zealand for over 14 years and this is truly better than most pies I had back in NZ. And they have Tim Tams! I love how you can also purchase them frozen, and stock up for future meals. Definitely worth it!  You don't have to be a homesick Aussie to love this place. You can, like me, be homesick for savoury Scottish pies. Or you can just love good food. In any event, they've got you sorted out.  I'm giving this place a 4.5\\/5 rounded up! Even at 4AM on a Wednesday (don't ask me why I'm up this late), I still salivate whenever I think about Ta Pies' absolutely delectable pies and side dishes. Although there is not much in terms of ambience at this location, the deliciousness of the food makes up for that by all means. As I've mentioned before, I'd rather have crappy ambience and amazing food rather than vice versa.\r\n\r\nI ordered the steak, bacon, and cheese pie in a combo with a side of mac and cheese and a drink. In addition, I also got a Lamington for a dessert since I never had one before and wanted to try something new. As soon as I cut into the pie, I was met with a waft of the most savory aroma and the crinkle of what appeared to be good-quality pastry. Every mouthful of meaty, smoky, and cheesy goodness made me crave for more, and it was surprisingly cheap for a nice steak-based meal. Combined with the tomato sauce in the filling, you really cannot get it any better than that. The mac and cheese, despite my initial doubts over how it seemed more watery than I would normally prefer, was still cheesy and had a bit of a kick to it as a result of the addition of certain vegetables, and the breadcrumbs on top were the perfect accent to a classic comfort food. \r\n\r\nThe Lamington, in my opinion, was a bit drier than I would've liked it to be, but then again I did go in the evening when there were only three of them left on display. I did enjoy, however, the combination of chocolate, raspberry (?) jam, and coconut that surrounded the outside, so I can only imagine how good it would have tasted had the cake been more moist.\r\n\r\nOverall, Ta Pies is a great place to go to if you want a cheap but definitely filling meal that is somewhat rare to find outside of its home continent. Who knows? I might stop by in the near future to grab some frozen pies to bring back home with me...  Now that I have actually spent a year around Oz and NZ, I had to go back here, do a new tasting and update my review accordingly...\r\nThe pies are not only delicious, they are damn close to the real thing you could find down under and over. Plus, I've finally opened my eyes and noticed that they also sell a bunch of ozzie products... If I ever get a vegemite craving, I now know where to go!  Bad surprise. People of Montreal, how can you find this place to incredible? I agree, the owner is super nice, and the pie concept is fun. But it is not super tasty, and it's quite expensive for what it is (just a few ingredients in a dough, basically). The sides were also so-so (we had mac & cheese and mashed potatoes). And finally, the shop itself is not really nice to eat in - I guess it's better to take away and go eat in the nearby park.\r\n\r\nA bit disappointed, even if Hugh Jackman seems to disagree :)  CHALLENGE ISSUED TO ALL YELPERS within the vicinity of Montreal! Go to Ta Pies and order the Tim Tam slam. You get a hot beverage with two chocolate covered cookie bars to use as "straws". I wouldn\'t have believed it if I didn\'t try it myself. You end up with a deliciously gooey chocolate mouthful. Check out how to do it here: https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/jgwhhqWxgQw\r\n\r\nNow about the pies: we ordered the steak, bacon and cheese individual pie with a side of delicious roasted (curried) veggies, a Lamington cake and Afghan cookie. The pie had a delectable flaky crust with tender meat, thick cut bacon and melty gooey cheese OH YES! I did my happy food dance. The roasted veggies were delicious but oily, next time I\'ll ask for the ones on top of the pile that have had a chance to drain. The desserts were dry and hard, wouldn\'t recommend.\r\n\r\nTiny place with tiny butt high stools: be careful not to topple over. Sweet, helpful, knowledgeable staff. Aussie tucker is BEAUTY!  Quite close to the real deal, these pies remind me a lot of my days as a backpacker in New-Zealand. This was their poutine (OK, this and maybe fish&chips) - cheap, filling, and available everywhere (literally - even gas stations stocked these in heaters, but you never knew how long it was sitting there...). \r\nThe Mtl version is great - not as dirt cheap as the original - but of good quality, and still quite affordable. I don't particularly like sitting here, and the terrace outside is not that great (Parc Av traffic in your face...), but if you are up for a quick and filling bite, or a take-out, it is a very good place.  Yam!  A lillte place with some pricey food .. ca depanne...  petite terrasse agreable, wifi available. Mais la facture est plus elev\xc3\xa9 que la portion..  Oh my these pies were awesome! They come in a variety of sizes (one serving size for about $6, regular pie-size for about $17, and mini-sizes) and if there aren't any fresh ones still hot in the warmer, there are packaged ones in the fridge. The crust was flaky and the filling was generous and if it wasn't the middle of winter and I wasn't so lazy, I would be headed there now to try more. There are probably about a dozen different pies (including a vegetarian one) and I intend to try all of them! \r\n\r\nIn case it's not obvious, this is not the place for dessert pies. There are a few dessert options (cookies, chocolate, pudding, most of which contain some coconut) but this is a savoury pie place and there are no dessert pies. (I would go to rockaberry for that!!)  came to try something i never tasted before; the Australian food. Juicy and voluminous pies, lot of choices even vegetarian, special rare desserts, great deal in frozen product. First impression was "tiny", but last impression was "wao I\'m really satisfied". \r\n\r\nits definitely worth to try in your lunch-snack time.  I love me some pies.  Sweet, savoury, as long as there is golden, buttery, flaky crust and something delicious inside, I\'m on board.  I first discovered this place on a tip from my old chef at a resto I worked at in the neighbourhood and popped in to check it out; pies that are of Australian nature?  Is this for realsies?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I was greeted by a couple of flags (Australian and New Zealand, in particular) and a chipper Qu\xc3\xa9becoise with a ridiculous, err, "Australian" accent.  She steered me towards an OG pie (Steak and Kidney) as well as a couple of newer ideas (Butter Chicken and Spinach with Ricotta) and I was promptly satisfied upon gobbling them down.  Over the proceeding weeks I managed to try all of their offerings and was never let down.  The crust is perfectly balanced and buttery and the fillings are always fun and delectable.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, they also sell the pies frozen so you can stock up for the winter months (October - June).  The appearance of this tiny restaurant does not match the big taste of  the food they serve at all...the pie I tried was amazingly delicious, the crust was so buttery and flaky and the veggies filling just perfect. They have a variety of unusual but delicious desserts, I tried the yoyo and it was heavenly....will be back again to try more pies and sweets.  Amazing pies, lots of choices too.\r\nLove this place.  Being from the Midwest of the USA, I hadn't had a lot of experience with meat pies until moving to Montreal.  But after some family dinners and a few visits to Tourtiere Australienne, I'm hooked.\r\n\r\nAmbiance:  The restaurant has a simple but straightforward layout.  The interior has seating for about about 12 and also functions as a shop for patron to grab some pre-made pies.  There is room for about 10 people to sit outside if weather permits.   The pies of the day sit in a warmer near the register ready for your selection.\r\n\r\nFood:  They had about 8 different varieties to choose from, including both meat and veggie options.  I had a meat-heavy pie that included some bacon and was not disappointed.  My dining companion let me sample her veggie filled choice which was also very tasty.  The pie's crust was light, flakey and delicious.  We tried to counterbalance the meat pie with one of TA's green salads and were pleased as well.\r\n\r\nService:  TA is a pretty casual place to grab a bite.  The woman who took our order also brought out the pies\\/salad in a timely and kind fashion.\r\n\r\nPrice:  Dinner for two was ~$25, which is reasonable for a quick dinner in Montreal by my standards.\r\n\r\nWe'll be back at TA and look forward to grabbing a few pies to take home to our freezer as well.  I\'d heard about this place for years but never ventured there for one reason or another. I can\'t believe I\'ve been missing out on this TASTY TASTY place lo these past 5 years (they recently celebrated their anniversary!).\r\n\r\nDefinitely a niche market but mon dieu it was lovely to sink into a crispy, warm steak and mushroom pie. Heard good things about the curried veg which I\'ll try next time but really, I\'d like to try every single one. They have fresh and frozen varieties and single serving pies from $5.00-6.50 or giant family pies for averaging $15. With a salad or soup on the side it would have been a filling, comforting meal. On it\'s own a nice, hearty snack!\r\n\r\nThey also have a great selection of sweets including this cake that I was told was Hugh Jackman\'s favorite when he was in town shooting Wolverine. A very light sponge cake (not too sweet) called a "LAMINGTON" with a bit of jam and dipped in chocolate\\/coconut. It might sound odd but it was SOOOO GOOD. They also stock 3 different varieties of TimTam cookies (trouble!) and some sweets that I\'d never seen before. The sticky toffee pudding with bourbon whipped cream also looked tempting but better on a cold, winter\'s night...  Brought home a steak, bacon and cheese large "family" sized pie and was pleasantly surprised how good it was!  First of all the crust was so crisp, buttery and tasty!  Seriously.... I usually eat minimal crust on a meat pie as I find it so tasteless and hard to swallow (without a big glass of milk)!  This crust tasted like having a croissant for the crust!  The filling inside had wonderful flavour and was not too dry and well portioned with sauce.  Flavour was fa-dabulous!  I did however think the pricing was a tad high for a frozen pie ($16.50 per large)!  I believe it\'s a bit of a rip-off to charge the same price for fresh as frozen but that\'s my "cheap prairie upbringing"!  I would like to try some of their other pies and deserts but wanted to try one out to see if it was the real-deal!  It sure is folks!  On my next trip I would like to try Butter Chicken, Rogan-Josh and possibly a Tiramisu!  I\'ll update after I chomp down on one or all!  I have never had an Australian meat pie but these may rank up there with the best dinner pies I\'ve eaten!  I've got to say that these are theeee best Australian pies I have ever had! 2 VEGETARIAN OPTIONS!!????\r\nSay What!?!\r\nMake sure to try the Curry as well as the Spinach Ricotta pie. They are both amazing.\r\nThey were also one of the few places that were open at 10 am on Labor Day. \r\nGo figure. \r\nI envy those of you who get to eat here whenever you want... I have to drive 6 hours to get here.  I went to Montreal to train fellow colleagues for a couple of days. After work on my final day, I decided to pull out my Yelp app and figure out where to go for dinner. I found this place, added the address to my GPS, and drove off. \r\n\r\nI love pies. I've never had an Aussie pie. I'm adventurous. When in Montreal... haha!\r\n\r\nI lucked out and got a parking spot right in front of the store. I went to pay for parking. The dispenser asked me to enter the parking number. I looked. I couldn't find it. I guess that parking was free, so I walked into the store. \r\n\r\nYou can eat there. However, there are two tiny tables that are high like bar tables. Instead, I checked out the selection of pies and dessert. I was in heaven!\r\n\r\nThe store sells warm pies. Perfect! I bought a couple and decided to spend a quiet night eating them in my hotel room, which had a kitchenette. I got the steak and mushroom, and steak and cheese pies. \r\n\r\nTo go, I grabbed a twelve-pack of frozen sausage rolls. The woman asked if I had a cooler. My car always has a cooler. I guess that this fact alone proves that I am a foodie! I reassured her that my hotel room had a full fridge. I'd freeze the sausage rolls before driving back home. She seemed relieved. \r\n\r\nThe woman at the counter was helpful and friendly. I paid by credit card and left. \r\n\r\nI returned to my hotel room and noticed how carefully the pies were wrapped. A cardboard insert protected them from any bumps. Each pie was carefully labelled in its own bag. It was a nice touch that was highly practical. \r\n\r\nI tore into the steak and mushroom pie. It was divine! The pastry was flaky and buttery. The pie filling was generous and delicious. I loved the mushrooms. They complemented the steak well. \r\n\r\nI then ate the steak and cheese. So good! It's comfort food wrapped into a neat, flaky pie. Yum!\r\n\r\nI haven't tried the sausage rolls yet, but they are safely in my freezer. I am going to guess that they are equally as yummy as the pies. \r\n\r\nWhen I'm back in Montreal, I need to add a pie run with my bagel run. What a wonderful gem of a place!\r\n\r\n(194)  The person in the front was super nice and I got my food quick. The Ned Kelly is quite tasty but not really a fan of the baked egg on the inside. I think a soft boiled or poached egg would have been FAR superior because it would have oozed out into the surrounding pie and presented an even better flavor. The Mac and Cheese was also good. Would come back to sample  the other pies.  Think small; tiny space, small counters and tables with a few chairs. It's very casual in a depanneur kinda way.\r\nSo my first suggestion is...maybe go for take out.\r\n\r\nNow let's talk PIE. I had a buy 1 get 1 free pie coupon which made my meal more even more affordable. If you want in on this deal without the coupon, follow ta-pies on Facebook or Twitter and they'll let you know when this promotion is happening! I bought the curried sweet potato pie, and my friend had the butter chicken pie. It cost us about $6 (including the coupon), which meant I paid only $3...score! \r\n\r\nAt first I thought I might need two pies to fill me up, but when the guy at the counter handed my pie over to me, I was happy to see it was a 'good size'. I'm sorry if I can't really give you the exact circumference, but hey, it was the perfect amount to fill my stomach. \r\n\r\nI wish my pie was liiiitttle warmer. It wasn't a fantastic pie, but it was tasty. And who can complain for the price?\r\n\r\nTa-pies also sells Australian goods at a high mark-up. I didn't get to try any of the desserts, but the coconut and chocolate dipped sponge cake looked a bit sad (and questionable) sitting in the large glass cookie jar on the counter. Anyone have any thoughts about the date pudding or the doughnut? I hope to try those at some point!  I love me a Kiwi pie & flat white! We discovered this place a week after our trip to New Zealand, and we have not looked back. It's a great place to get a mince pie, or my favourite a mince and cheese. \r\n\r\nThe business is run by a husband(Don) and wife(Melanie). Don having been a professional chef in New Zealand and later Australia,met Melanie and they married and moved to Montreal. The pies made using local ingredients, and come very very close to the pies of Russel or Lake Taupo NZ!\r\n\r\nThey have a large variety of pies that you can take home frozen. Either individual or family size.  Often they have specials, such as a pie of the week or a baker's dozen promotion. \r\n\r\nThe frozen pies also transport very well. Putting them in a cooler bag or small cooler box we were able to give some to my cousin in Calgary who married a Kiwi. He gave his approval of them. \r\n\r\nThey also make great flat whites, and are not too expensive.\r\n\r\nOn weekends Don will usually have a rugby or Aussie rules football game on the TV.\r\n\r\nIn the summer time they have a pie eating contest - I believe the current record is 8.5 pies in ten minutes.  As an Australian I was excited to find this gem when visiting Montreal. And wow it did deliver! I left feeling like I'd been back home for a little while. Here's why:\r\n\r\n- I had the classic beef pie, and possibly the best meat pie I've ever had. The pastry was amazing and surpassed that of pastries in Australia, perhaps the french influence. Tomato sauce and some Australian brand chutneys were freely available.\r\n\r\n- My boyfriend noted the pies are surprisingly filling for $5-6 each.\r\n\r\n- They can show you how to do a Tim-tam slam, for those interested in Aussie culturalisms.\r\n\r\n- They offer 'lemon lime and bitters', an Aussie mixer drink that trust me, is pretty hard to find in north America.\r\n\r\n- The girl at the counter has worked as a barista in Australia, and the quality of the coffee really reflects this.\r\n\r\n- The traditional sticky date pudding was great, but difficult to chose from the several dessert options including pavlova and Tim-tam tiramisu.\r\n\r\n- When buying a take-home pie for later, I noticed the bill pleasantly reflected that advertised prices included tax - not sure if this was the same for our eat-in meal. The take-home pie was also amazing.\r\n\r\nThis place will be on my radar for every time I return to Montreal, and really shouldn't be missed. If you're an expat missing home, or interested in seeing what real Australian food is, this place is a must.  I have passed this little gem walking to and from work for quite some time and never gave it a second thought until yesterday when I did a quick yelp search and saw all the great reviews.  I decided to try it for myself and am glad I did.  WOW!  I called and spoke to a very nice woman who helped me narrow down my order.  I got the family size Butter Chicken and Curry Veg.  My family and I enjoyed every bite.  I do recommend calling early as I believe they may run out of certain pies before closing.  Depuis mon ann\xc3\xa9e en Australie, je n\'ai plus jamais mang\xc3\xa9 de tourte \xc3\xa0 la viande. Pourtant je n\'\xc3\xa9tais pas forc\xc3\xa9ment fan des meat pie Australienne, souvent trop grasses et g\xc3\xa9latineuses \xc3\xa0 mon go\xc3\xbbt... Mais nostalgie oblige (et curiosit\xc3\xa9 surtout ;) me voil\xc3\xa0 en route pour La Tourti\xc3\xa8re Australienne.\r\n\r\nTA ressemble \xc3\xa0 une petite \xc3\xa9picerie avec quelques tables. Dans un grand frigo, plusieurs tourtes, individuelles et d\'autres plus grandes \xc3\xa0 acheter pour ramener chez soi. Que de choix ! Il y a m\xc3\xaame certaines "sp\xc3\xa9cialit\xc3\xa9s" Aussies comme le Vegemite ou les fameux Tim Tam :)\r\n\r\nJ\'opte pour la tourte tomates s\xc3\xa9ch\xc3\xa9es \\/ ricotta \\/ champignons et mon ch\xc3\xa9ri opte pour la tourte viande - fromage avec en accompagnement une petite salade maison. Simple mais efficace. Rapide et vraiment bon. Et en dessert, un excellent pudding aux dattes \xc3\xa0 tomber par terre... yummy ! Tout \xc3\xa7a pour un tout petit prix. J\'ai pass\xc3\xa9 un agr\xc3\xa9able moment Australien :)\r\n\r\nBref, j\'y retournerai car il y a beaucoup d\'autres tourtes (et de desserts) \xc3\xa0 essayer !!  I really like Ta Pies (I used to come and buy their frozen pies and eat them at home very often). The pies (especially the flavoured ones) do not resemble Australian meat pies much but the combination of a flaky crust, a warm and juicy sauce and chunky pieces of meat and vegetables makes this place a must try. Their individual sized pies are also quite cheap (around 5-7$) and feeds one person!.  Quite possibly the best pie I\'ve had in my life!", said my friend after eating here (OK it was actually my internal monologue, but my friend did agree that the pie was delicious ;D).\r\n\r\nI\'ll admit, I\'m new to the concept of pies as a meal, I\'ve always associated pies with dessert.  Ta Pies make delectable meal-pies (I don\'t know if that\'s a thing but I\'m going to run with it) in many varieties, for omnivores and vegetarians alike.  I really enjoyed the spinach, mushroom, tomato, and Ricotta cheese pie, as well as the curried vegetable pie.  I ordered some meat pies for some friends from work, the steak and mushroom, and the steak, bacon, and mushroom, and they raved about them.  Even I was tempted, based on the pies I had.\r\n\r\nThis spot isn\'t limited to only pies, though, they also make a variety of desserts, salads, and most importantly milkshakes!  They even have a special one called a "thickshake" which they make with extra scoops of ice cream and a thickening agent.  The regular milkshake was good but damn was the thickshake fine!\r\n\r\nTa Pies make single-serving as well as family size pies, and the pies are available hot, refrigerated, or frozen.  If you want to eat in or pick up a hot pie, it\'s best to call ahead because it takes 20 minutes to heat up, which they will do for you, so you can arrive and the pie will be ready to eat.  Mmmmmmm :D\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?  Ta Pies definately deserves a 5 star rating! I recently tried out this wonderful gem located on Parc Avenue and was blown away by their tasty and flavor packed austrailian meat pies! The spot itself is small but they do have a small counter spots and outdoor terrace so you can eat there. The owner is super friendly and so helpful in explaining each of their pies. Now for the pies..brace yourself as they have so many wonderful pies to choose from...the most popular ones are the classic beef and butter chicken. They also have a wonderful curry vegetarian pie. My fav was the classic beef which was out of this world! One word..delicious!! All their pies come in individual portions or regular pie size and they have frozen ones which are perfect for takeout!  I truly recommend trying this spot at least once! Will definately go back!  I had the Butter Chicken Pie and Corn Flake cookie and lets just say I am counting down the days for my return. The pastry was flaky, the butter chicken was nicely flavored, from the first bite I wanted more! The cookie was was just AMAZING not to sweet but sweet enough and the taste of the corn flakes complemented the chocolate perfectly. Next time I bring home some frozen Pies and a dozen cookies for sure. Please keep up the great cooking, you mad me a fan!!!!!!!  As an Australian who's been away from home for over a year now Ta Pies was just what I needed to curb some of the home sickness.  I have been back a few times now with my girlfriend who is French-Canadian and she is hooked as well. I think their traditional mince pie is my favourite, but we have sampled quite quite a few of their selection now and they were all delicious. \r\n\r\nI can say with confidence Ta pies are definitely on the mark with quality and taste. They are equal if not better to a lot of really well known bakeries from my home town in Tasmania.\r\n\r\nThey also have a number of Australian lollies\\/treats for sale including curly wurlys (my favourite as a kid) Anzac Cookies, Lamingtons, Milo etc.\r\n\r\nThis place is great if you are also in a hurry or need something for dinner later as you can buy refrigerated pies in different sizes to warm up at home.  Meat pies were one of the highlights of our trip to Australia\\/New Zealand. The only disappointment we had in discovering this place is that we didn't find it earlier  Overall :\r\nIf you eat nothing else on your visit to Montreal, you must try Ta Pies.  Seriously - go out of your way, this place is a gem.\r\n\r\nFood :\r\nMy partner had the buttered chicken (sort of a curry chicken flavor) and I had the beef and cheese.  Hers was delicious and really flavorful, mine was excellent.  The crust was buttery and flaky, and the filling was well seasoned with the cheese as an accent rather than an overwhelming element.  My partner lived in Australia for a while and confirmed, these were pretty perfect and totally authentic.  I have never put anything in my mouth that made me this happy.\r\n\r\nEverything Else :\r\nNot much else to say - seating is sparse and mostly outdoors.  Service is counter-style ordering.  Decor... no real impression.  I don't take any stars off for this because Ta Pies is exactly what it seems like - a side of the road pie stand for you to grab a handheld bite and go.  Perfect!  Every time we visit Montreal we absolutely have to visit Tourtiere Australienne.  This cozy and casual gem of a place has a chef who has mastered the art of buttery flaky pastry. \r\n \r\nIndividual pies look small but pack so much goodness and are surprisingly filling.  The only problem is which delicious pie to choose....mmm... butter chicken, steak and mushroom, spinach\\/ricotta, lamb roganjosh, and their breakfast pies are absolutely mouth watering.  To top it off,  their pavlova with whip cream, topped with fruit is divine!  Dine in or take it to go.  They are located near a couple of parks, so having an impromptu New Zealand\\/Aussie style picnic is a delightful way to enjoy this authentic grub.\r\n\r\nThe young couple who own and run the place are very sweet and welcoming .  She is Quebecois and we expeciallly enjoyed hearing her speak english to us in her Australian\\/French accent.\r\n\r\nPass the tomato sauce, listen to some tunes from "Down Under", fill your belly with gourmet food VERY inexpesively, and leave with your very own jar of Vegemite.  \r\n\r\nTa!  Very helpful service at the desk and the pies are excellent!  The standard meat (beef) and butter chicken (yes!!) were de-lish.  They even have lamb!  It was a hit with the hubby and the kids.  \r\n\r\nWith a picture of Aussie Hugh Jackman (the Wolverine of X Men) displayed prominently on the wall, what's not to like?\r\n\r\nOnly four stars for the limited seating.  Yes. Brilliant. Delicious homemade pies made with love. Perfect for when you don't have time to cook. Reluctant to mention my favourite as I don't want it to run out! Have had several: spinach & cheese, curried veg and beef and cheese. The sizes are generous and will feed 4 adults along with a side salad. Crunchy flaky buttery toppings. Love this place and so happy it's around the corner from my place! Great service - they will heat up your pie in advance if you call and they even stayed open 10mins longer so I could collect my pie in minus temps! Don't go changing Ta Pies!  I went there for the first time based on the reviews I read here. Bought the pepper steak, brought it home and baked for 35 minutes as told by the friendly employee there. I\'d say it\'s one of the best pies I\'ve tried so far. The pie shell was flaky and light, on the on inside, boy the taste was awesome. Enough pieces of cubed meat and that dark sauce.... mmmm, didn\'t bother to check what else they put in there because was too busy enjoying the perfect balance of this pie. The only slight negative thing I found was the price. I paid $17 for a 9" pie which I found it to be a bit pricey considering it\'s weight. Other than that, two thumbs up!  Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\r\n\r\nOK firstly, this was my first time going to a tortiere shop\\/restaurant.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, these are the best damned pie crusts you'll find anywhere.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the filling (I've only had butter chicken) was shockingly good.  There isn't an Indian anywhere on premises, but that butter chicken was kickin'.  Excuse the rhyme.\r\n\r\nMy friend got the cookie that I'd bought but forgotten in his glove compartment, and he swore that, like the pies, that cornflakes and chocolate cookie was maybe the best cookie he's ever eaten!  \r\n\r\nI wouldn't say it's a place with good food - I'd say it's a place that you should absolutely eat at if you get the chance.  This is not regular good.  It's unique good.  Nous nous sommes fait livr\xc3\xa9 une tarte familiale b\xc5\x93uf et cheddar (chauff\xc3\xa9e) avec comme \xc3\xa0 c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 la pur\xc3\xa9e de pommes de terre et le gravy: c'\xc3\xa9tait succulent et la tarte est arriv\xc3\xa9e \xc3\xa0 la maison \xc3\xa0 la parfaite temp\xc3\xa9rature.\r\nC'\xc3\xa9tait une premi\xc3\xa8re et on recommandera, c'est certain! \r\nLes prix sont honn\xc3\xaates et la qualit\xc3\xa9 est l\xc3\xa0.  This was an amazing bakery. I had a lamb pie and a beef pie, their mac and cheese side dish, and a lamington (a square of cake with raspberry jam in the middle covered in chocolate and coconut). The pies were flaky, warm, and filling. I was particularly impressed with the pie pastry, which the owner said they make from scratch. They would be perfect as an afternoon snack on a cold winter day. The mac and cheese was a tad watery for my taste, but not bad overall. As for the lamington, it was light and fluffy, and the raspberry jam was perfect against the light chocolate and coconut filling. The owner was very nice, and even shared with us where she got her recipes.  Fell in love with mince pies during my stints in NZ and AUS, and never could find something comparable in NYC. One bite of Ta Pies mince and cheese took me back! Flavor is spot on and crust to filling ratio is perfect. Butter chicken is great, but mince and cheese lives on forever in my dreams. Loved all the other NZ\\/AUS products they had as well. I wish there was a Ta Pies in my city, but for now I'll just have to come back to Montreal for my pie fix.  Delicious. My daughters love the sausage rolls, I'm partial to the Ned Kelly, though I've tried other flavors and really liked them. My husband finds them too rich, but he's not writing the review so I'll not remove a star for that.  It's been a long time since i had good meat pies. In fact the last time i had them was in Sydney and in NZ'ed. These are just as good and in fact, better than some I had down-undah!  I had the classic steak and cheese, and the steak bacon and cheese, to dine in.  both so  A few minutes from Parc Jean Mance this place is one of a kind. Special pies based on Aussie and Kiwi staples that you won't find anywhere else in Montreal. They gave a very large selection including vegetarian options and they're all equally delicious. Besides the great pies they also have excellent sweets that you also can't find elsewhere. Perfect for take out or else they have a small terrace on Parc.  Quand je suis paresseuse, je file m'acheter un repas r\xc3\xa9confort parmi une des nombreuses tourti\xc3\xa8res offertes. J'en profite pour me procurer leurs fameuses boules au rhum  No place in Montreal captured my heart quite like Ta Pies did.\r\n\r\nTa Pies is an Australia\\/NZ influenced bakery that focuses on a really well defined value proposition: present traditional ANZ comfort food with a more contemporary interpretation at an extremely affordable price. It\'s a very tightly run ship and the first time I went there one of the owners excused herself as I debated between all the temptations in front of, and around me, to run into the kitchen and put a batch of Anzac biscuits (rolled oats, coconut, and golden syrup) into the oven. Hey, I like that they\'re focused on controlling overheads: it will keep prices down.\r\n\r\nI truly had no idea what I was getting into. I\'d heard about the popularity of the meat pies down under and so requested the Butter Chicken (served with a side of, somewhat boring, mashed potatoes) to be heated up. Contrary to most other bakeries that reheat in a manner that detracts from the enjoyment, this one was done to the exact second where it was piping hot as I cut into the pie, but the exterior hadn\'t been made soggy by the moisture. As I had my first slice, I realized that what was inside was actually an Indian chicken curry (with tomato, yoghurt, and ginger). Completely unexpected, even if the name should have tipped me off. I actually found the combination fascinating: much superior to any "Dum Pukht" interpretation in Indian dishes (that cook the meat inside a layer of bread) given the crispy, flaky, buttery exterior of the pie, and the distinct layers of pastry dough. Fantastic! There are many options spanning: steak sausage, beef, bacon, lamb... you must definitely try the meat pies. I\'m glad I did, despite Hugh Jackson\'s ringing endorsement ;)\r\n\r\nNo meal is complete without dessert and so I was curious to try as much as I could from their unique desserts. It was a hot day and so the owner recommended: Hokey Pokey ice cream (vanilla ice cream with small lumps of honeycomb toffee). I tried it a few days later and thought it was ok. I didn\'t understand why it would be so popular in NZ till i researched and realized that many New Zealanders remember making hokey pokey in science at school to "observe the dramatic chemical changes when baking soda is mixed with golden syrup and sugar". Fair enough, I can respect nostalgia.\r\n\r\nInstead I had two delightful desserts: the Lamington (vanilla sponge cake filled with raspberry jam, dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut) and the Afghan (dark chocolate cookie with corn flakes). Both were 5 star experiences with an interesting twist: the Lamington, an Australian specialty cake traced back to 1900 (and amusingly discovered in 2014 to have actually been invented earlier in NZ as "Wellington"!) was extremely light, soft, and moist. The Afghan cookie (the origin of whose name is still a mystery and could end up being controversial in coming years) had all kinds of interesting plays happening with the chocolate cookie and the dark chocolate icing with the walnut adding a texture element to it - till a few seconds into eating it you realized another gravel-like consistency in it: thanks to the addition of corn flakes into the baking mix.\r\n\r\nAs I turned to leave and had a good conversation with the owner, she inquired how I\'d heard of them. Yelp, I replied and she beamed at all the glowing reviews here. I couldn\'t figure out the name, was it short for good bye, as in Ta Ta? No, she said. It\'s slang down under for "Thanks a lot".\r\n\r\nTa, then... (4.5 stars, rounded up)  Ordered food from Just Eat and was pleasantly surprised. The food came piping hot and delicious. I have tried a few pies off their menu as well as their mac & cheese, mashed potatoes and mushed peas. I truly can't get enough.\r\nThe food is cheap, delicious, handmade... Marry me?????  DELICIOUS & AUTHENTIC! I stopped by TA on the way to the park and was pleasantly surprised, actually impressed. Anyone familiar with New Zealand and Australian meat pies will have high expectations, like I did, when seeing a sign outside this semi-whole-in-the-wall spot advertising meat pies. TA delivered ... very hot and very fresh, which is the opposite of a complaint, just difficult to wait for it too cool sufficiently before eating. The pastry crust was PERFECT and the fillings delicious.    \r\n\r\nThe space is small, very small, and definitely not a dinner destination or for a meal of any great length. I'll reiterate, if you're familiar with how things work in NZ and Australia and how to order and eat meat pies, there's no surprises aside from being 100% satisfied with the food. \r\n\r\nI'll be back ... soon  Ordered some pies for a Christmas party! I was stunned at how awesome they tasted! I really crave for more.. Rates are pretty reasonable, too! \r\nSince almost all of the people in the party were vegetarian, we got the curried vegetables and sweet potatoes one, and the spinach, ricotta one. I am very difficult when it comes to eating vegetables.. Don't like sweet potatoes and run away from spinach.. But this was something!! I was really surprised when I tried it and finished a good slice of each!  \r\nReally looking forward to trying other things from the menu :)  Good but the chicken pie's way too rich and the dough wasn't cooked you can still see the butter and too pricy for a tiny pie.  Wow, just wow! First time to eat an Australian hand pie. We talked to the owner who told us these are gourmet pies, house-made puff pastry made only with New Zealand butter, which she told us does not at all compare to fast-food hand pies in Australia. I had a lamb roganjosh, hubby had curried vegetable, plus we had a side of roasted veggies. Lunch for two about $17. This is outrageously good food at a cheap price. Highly recommend!!! Follow up: we decided to not forgo dessert: Lamington cake, a sponge cake with raspberry filling, dipped in chocolate, rolled in flaked coconut for me, Afghan cookie for hubby, which is dark chocolate and corn flakes, topped with chocolate ganache and half a walnut. Both were marvelous, a fabulous end to a wonderful meal. Total price $27 for lunch and dessert, a bargain!  I may be biased since I'm Australian, but Aussie pies such as those made by TA beat any other pies made in la belle province. Their fillings are juicy and their crust sufficiently crisp and easy to break into without leaving that dry taste in your mouth. I've tried their classic meat pies, the vegetable curry, and the beef and mushoom. They're all good. I just wish that the pies were bigger because one is definitely not enough for a meal. For a more authentic feel, have your pies with mash and gravy on top. It's fun to eat and tastes wonderful. The place is tiny, so go there on a nice sunny day and enjoy your pie at Jeanne-Mance park.  Small pie place you can easily miss on Parc.\r\nThere are a few seats inside but I usually buy frozen pies and enjoy them at home.\r\nI have lived in Australia for 4 years and these pies are even better than most pies I had there. I've been buying the pies there for nearly 2 years and I have never been disappointed. Great choice too (meat, vegetarian).\r\nThey also sell other Aussie classics like Vegemite & Tim Tams.\r\nDefinitely worth trying!  Arriv\xc3\xa9 sur place, je n'\xc3\xa9tais vraiment pas certain que j'allais aimer et j'ai vraiment bas\xc3\xa9 mon choix sur un gut feeling. \r\nJ'ai essay\xc3\xa9: Carr\xc3\xa9 Ragonosh d'agneau = Excellent, un peu \xc3\xa9pice\r\nJ'ai aussi prit Chilli Con Carne! En p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9? qui l'eut cr\xc3\xbb!? C'est EXCELLENT!\r\nLe p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 au Steak: du r\xc3\xb4ti de palette avec une sauce tomate en p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9! C'est bien! pas mon pr\xc3\xa9f\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 du lot mais quand m\xc3\xaame. \r\nFinalement, ma m\xc3\xa8re elle a mang\xc3\xa9 celui Bacon et Poulet et elle va vraiment aim\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa7a!\r\n\r\nBeau, Bon , Pas cher! Hey je suis pour!!  Their flaky pies with various sauces with tender chunks of meat (beef, lamb, etc.) were so good indeed. Though we didn\'t try a well-known Australian dish, "the floating pie," a meat pie floating on green pea soup, out of ignorance - next time for sure, we tried Lamington cake!! There are a few descriptions on the historical origins of Australian street food items on the wall, interesting read.\r\n\r\nIf you visit Tourti\xc3\xa8re Australienne, you can find various kinds of meat pies with different sauces in two size: mini and 6 inches. Also, they sell frozen pies which were not cooked yet, so just pop them in the oven! (nice to bring a couple of them for Sunday family dinner!)\r\n\r\nDon\'t forget to taste their scrumptious homemade desserts as well :)  We had sausages, butter chicken and chilli corn carne. One better than the other one. We'll be back!!  So many varieties of gourmet meat pies, and so tasty! The service was great and the outdoor patio was a nice place to enjoy the meal. There were deserts, but I can't imagine using any room in my stomach for anything but the pies.  Who would have known, a Hawaii boy, all the way in Montreal, eating Australian Meat pies..\r\n\r\nFound this place from Uncle Anthony from his show. The Layover.\r\n\r\nThis place is a little bit hard to find because the signage is just a picture. Just be on the look out for their logo with the drawing of a head and your at the right place. Parking was a little bit of a pain because they were doing road construction when I went. \r\n\r\nFirst off the, the person behind the counter was really really nice, esp when i asked what was popular. She went over the pies that were in the little container on the counter top. She told me what was in every one of them and they all sounded great.\r\n\r\nI just opted for the meat pie with pieces of meat in side of it. I wasn't sure exactly the name but here is a picture of it.\r\n\r\nhttp:\\/\\/www.yelp.com\\/biz_photos\\/tourti%C3%A8re-australienne-montr%C3%A9al-2?select=grvRUVuNe4-kO1hvBftORg#fNKibIZflLlbrhBdplSBdQ\r\n\r\nhttp:\\/\\/www.yelp.com\\/biz_photos\\/tourti%C3%A8re-australienne-montr%C3%A9al-2?select=grvRUVuNe4-kO1hvBftORg#eRdIzu7ZaKbBY-ME5_00Dg\r\n\r\nI opt to take it to go because I was just getting food for me and my friend who was back at the Condo. I also did get their popular item which was the Tiramusu..\r\n\r\nI heated the meat pies for breakfast before we headed to the Grand Prix circuit. I used the oven that was in our Condo and the pies came out great and fantastic. Tasted like they were just freshly baked.\r\n\r\nMy friend who is a really picky eater, enjoyed his meat pie and said it was really good.\r\n\r\nThe Tiramusu was pretty on point too.\r\n\r\nOver all, fantastic, place and I'll be visiting them again when i'm in MTL.  Delicious pies with meat stuffing in warm flaky pastry shells.  Great inexpensive lunch spot. Helpful and courteous service.  We happen to stumble upon it while looking for a burger joint.  Much more satisfying than having the usual burger.  Being Australian its hard not to have mixed expectations for a pie shop selling Aussie cuisine.\r\nAussie pies are hard to beat and TA succeeds fairly well at nailing the Aussie meat pie. There is a wide variety of flavours many of which I have never seen in oz like Butter Chicken but still taste amazing whilst nailing the flaky pastry. We purchased the Steak, Bacon and Cheese; Butter Chicken and the Shephards pie varieties. I enjoyed them all although my bf was a little disappointed with the shephards pie.\r\n\r\nTA also sells a variety of Aussie desserts including Pavlova and Rum Balls. I decided to purchase a Tim Tam Meringue which I was fairly disappointed in as the whole pie crust was burnt and quite hard to bite into so I wouldn't recommend purchasing them.\r\n\r\nOverall it is a fairly good representation of some typical Aussie food that can be a little expensive at $5-6 for a pie but well worth a try if just to get my Aussie food fix.  Good chef-not just any old pie.  Very nice desserts.  Chef has real talent, and this is a must go for a cheap delicious meal.  you want some pies? This is one of those awesome restaurants  for that.. Their pies are incredible, with savoury filling and perfectly flaky crust ...like momma used to make....I usually go for the 3-for-deal on the family-size pies and a few highlights are definitely the green chili thai chicken pie,...The sweet potato curry and classic potato top my list, too.  I missed the flavours of meat pies and sausage rolls from New Zealand where I spend 2 of my high school years there. The gravy and the pastry just reminded the days where I spend my youth days. Must try this if you think most North American pies are mediocre and too sweet!  The pies are amazingly good! I've been there with a friend for lunch: even the side dishes are good. Great deals!  Who even knew Australian meat pies were a thing?! Well apparently they are, and I couldn't be happier. \r\n\r\nTa is tucked away so you might not find it at first, but double back if you miss it, because this place is worth it. \r\n\r\nThey've got everything from traditional ground beef and sausage pies, all the way to Indian dish inspired ones,and each is as good as the next. Plus, for a small extra fee, they'll top any one with a heaping mound of mashed potatoes. \r\n\r\nSo stop by if you can. It's to-TA-lly worth it. I'll show myself out.  Came towards the end of the night- there were too many choices, but the lady behind the counter was very helpful with letting us know what was popular- unfortunately the "Butter Chicken" pies were all sold out, but we satisfied ourselves with a lamb rogajosh & a steak+mushroom pie.  The little pies looked little , BUT they surely were substantial! especially since we had them both "Stacked" (aka topped with mashed potatoes, mushy peas, and gravy)  The picture out front doesn\'t do this \'a la mode\' version justice- there were double, triple quadruple portions of topping on our pies!  Which worked out just fine for us as we were extrememly hungry...  The pies were TASTY- nice pastry (although the topping did soggy-fy the crust slightly) had flavourful fillings, and generous hunks of meat inside.  The only complaint- not as piping hot as one might wish.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is definitely a more casual space- just a couple tables- people seem to do a lot of take out here especially since the pies are available as frozen for taking home and reheating.  The Lamington was also a tasty dessert choice- not too sweet vanilla cake with a bit of cream\\/raspberry coated with chocolate and shredded coconut- a very nice choice to end up the meal as we were stuff and anything sweeter, heavier,or larger would\'ve exploded our stomachs.....\r\n\r\nA good choice for something slightly different.  Great pies. Friendly staff. Try the rum balls as well awesome  Solid meat pies and good service got a classic beef\\/b\xc5\x93uf and got a sticky toffee pudding both warmed up and they were both very good my husband loved the meat pie and the sticky toffee was delicious warm I couldn't eat it all but it came with extra caramel and a whipped cream. Very lit !  Great little place with authentic Australian fair. We ordered a traditional pie, steak and mushroom pie and a sausage roll. Everything tasted good, just like in Australia. The sausage roll and traditional pie were my faves but hubby loved the steak and mushroom pie. The place itself is pretty simple, not the type of place to have a cozy lunch but great to pop in for a quick and easy bite.  Hungry for Australian cuisine? Then you better make your way here!\r\n\r\nIt's a small little shop near the park. A friend did research where to eat and find this place! Ta Pies is great for all things pies and desserts! They sell Australian products like Tim Tam (the best!), Vegemite, Milo, etc. They also have Tim Tam Homemade ice cream which is divine! Best thing ever created. So, friends and I were there to take out and bring back to our hotel. The lovely lady at the counter said a whole pie would take 35 minutes to be ready, which was fine with us. She was very nice and explain to us what each pie was and what tim tams were and how to eat them (even though I already knew). After 10 minutes of deciding, or what felt like 10 minutes, we got a spinach and cheese pie. The place is quite small, you can eat inside or outside on the patio. We went to the park that was a block away instead of waiting inside the shop. I think she was waiting for us cause the pie was under the heat lamp. She gave us a bag, plates, and forks. \r\n\r\nOnto the actual food tasting, the crust looked so crumbly with buttery goodness! It was great. It was definitely a different type of dough crust that I'm used to. It wasn't flaky, but it a couple layers. I really liked it. Lots of filling to go with it too. Very filling.  Place tr\xc3\xa8s sympa pour un brunch qui change. Mon chum a pris la BIG TA Pie avec pur\xc3\xa9e de patates et pur\xc3\xa9e de pois, quant \xc3\xa0 moi j'ai opt\xc3\xa9 pour une tourti\xc3\xa8re breakfast (oignon, \xc5\x93uf, bacon) et un dessert, + 2 caf\xc3\xa9s, des bonbons et le sourire de la vendeuse = 17.50$ ! \r\nBien rassasi\xc3\xa9 sans \xc3\xaatre lourd, pour nous c'\xc3\xa9tait parfait!  I'm not Australian or a New Zealander which is probably why I don't feel as connected or committed to this store as the others.\r\n\r\nI do like that they sell Milo (love that stuff) and Vegemite (yes I eat it, and I am not from Down Under)... but the pies were OK. They were well made, and rich and good, but I had a vegan wrap earlier that day and it was much better than the pie (I am drooling to get another  vegan wrap again).. which only tells me that the pie was just OK.\r\n\r\nI do love me a good puff pastry pie though, but I can make better at home with some President's Choice puff pastry pie and stuff it with chicken thigh meat, veggies and cream.. mmmmm\r\n\r\nI was actually really looking forward to eating the chicken and mushroom pie but that's a special pie apparently, made once a month. BOO!\r\n\r\nI would have tried the traditional minced meat pie but I don't eat ground beef any more (*cough*becauseooftheammoniawashingfecesawayfromthemeat*cough*).\r\n\r\nVery limited seating, reasonably priced at $6. I'd come back and eat if I was in the area and hungry, but I won't make a special trip out there to eat this once a week.  Fantastic pies, cakes and croissants. I had the delicious chocolate croissant and the strawberry pie. Oh boy, I can't describe how much I enjoyed the magnificent items from this restaurant. Cream fillings, rich chocolate, crispy shells, smooth and soft. \r\n\r\nI wish I was still in Montreal to try all the pastries, the other delicacies and items from their restaurant. \r\n\r\nSurely recommend this place.\r\n\r\n-SH  Oh man that was some good pie.  I was hearing lots of good things about Ta Pies, a casual eatery specializing in Australian meat pies, so I was very curious to give it a go.  It's a tiny and unassuming shop on Parc Ave that packs a lot of punch.  In  addition to having meat pies they have vegetarian options and Australian desserts.  You can also buy frozen pies to take home and heat up later.\r\n\r\nThey have a really good selection of pies so it was hard to narrow down my choices but ultimately I got a steak and cheese pie and I was happy I did.  In addition to a flaky, buttery crust the meat was very tender.  This was accompanied by a side of macaroni and cheese which was okay but not the best I have ever had.  Dessert was a yoyo, a kind of shortbread cookie sandwich with a passion fruit buttercream which was awesome.  I really enjoyed the passion fruit filling.\r\n\r\nIn addition to serving excellent food they also have fantastic customer service.  The people who work here are super friendly and the woman who served me was good at making recommendations and helping me narrow down my choices.  They also very kindly replaced my mac and cheese free of charge when I accidentally knocked it onto the ground despite my offering to pay for a new one.  I appreciated that.\r\n\r\nThe prices were very fair for the neighbourhood.  I paid about $15 total for all the food I ordered and a bottle of water which wasn't expensive at all when you consider the quality of the food and that you are in a neighbourhood like the Plateau.  Hugh Jackman had it right when he gave Ta Pies his endorsement.  It is awesome!  Ta Pies gets the Hugh Jackman Seal of Approval! So says the sandwich board outside. We were not as easily impressed as Wolverine.\r\n\r\nTa Pies is a tiny spot. We received the offer of two pies from the hot case for the price of one since they were closing in less than an hour after we arrived.\r\n\r\nNo one loved the food. The kids had the classic beef pie filled with (shocker!) ground beef. The husband and I shared the veggie pie with sweet potato curry. It was fine. We waited 20 minutes for them to warm up the butter chicken pie. That was the best of the bunch, but still not worth a return visit.\r\n\r\nWe ended our meal with an Afghan cookie and a Lammington to go but they were pretty unremarkable.  I got the sweet-potato-curry-vegetarian pie with lentil soup. Both were very delicious. The pie portion looked small, but was actually very reasonable. The lentil soup turned out to be more of a chili (it was so thick we could eat it with a fork), but was nevertheless very flavourful with a touch of spiciness. The other pies were tried were equally as great, with a consistently good crust and tasty fillings. Great place, definitely want to try some desserts next.  Hugh Jackman is right. They really do make the best meat pies in the world. Perfect flavour and consistency. My favourites are butter chicken and the classic beef and cheese. It's a must try for everyone. \r\n\r\nThey also have a bunch of other Australian\\/New Zealand food options. Desserts and snacks. It's great! My boyfriend has had the mac and cheese and says it's the best he's ever had. \r\n\r\nI really want to try the milkshakes and the pastries soon!\r\n\r\nThe service is always top notch. Friendly and helpful.  Visited Ta on Wednesday afternoon to grab some comfort food for my girlfriend who is still recovering from surgery.  She wanted to try a meat pie.  Now I know these aren't Canadian style meat pies, but Wolverine said they were legit, and who am I to argue with the most BA X-Man ever?  If I lived in Montreal I would probably eat here every day, I would also probably be obese.  Selection of hot pies was a little limited as it was later in the day, but I was able to pick up two steak and cheese pies, one for me to eat there and one to take back to my girlfriend.  All I can say is, how do we not have these in the states?  The crust was light and flaky and basically melted in my mouth.  For a $6 meal I expected the steak to be tough and not flavorful, I couldn't have been more wrong.  The meat was tender and juicy and the gravy and cheese inside were in perfect proportions.  I complimented my meal with some mushy peas, which I think were good, but as a Yank, have really no idea what they're supposed to taste like.  I grabbed two ANZAC biscuits (they are NOT cookies!) and a lemon\\/lime and bitters (which was quite refreshing on an 80 something degree afternoon) and hit the road back to the convalescence home.  My lady was equally impressed, though to be fair, she has been eating hospital food for two weeks.  Anyways, this small spot is a must do for a lunch or a quick snack for anyone living or visiting Montreal.  The space is tiny but the service and quality of the food more than made up.  Cheers!  J'adore! De tout pour plaire \xc3\xa0 tout le monde. Les tartes sont savoureuses et l\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa8res, les l\xc3\xa9gumes grill\xc3\xa9s sont bien relev\xc3\xa9s, les desserts sont tout aussi succulents. C'est pas tr\xc3\xa8s cher non plus. Et en plus ils vendent des Tim Tam's  Their sweet potato curry pie is amazing and you have to get the Tam Tam ice cream! Thinking about the place makes me drool.  First time I had australian pies so I have no idea how its supposed to taste like. What I can say is the puff pastry was excellent. But as most British-decent foods, it was bland and greasy. I didnt have the butter chicken pie though, which is apparently one of the best.  They're in NDG now! \r\nImagine the glee when we learned that TA was bringing its pies to Monkland Ave \\/ Girouard!  Villa Maria is the closest Metro stop\r\n\r\nSo far the pies we've had (as take-out) are:\r\n\r\nSteak Bacon Cheese. Verdict = Delicious\r\n\r\nButter Chicken. Verdict = Oh, Yummy!\r\n\r\nSpinach, mushroom, tomato & ricotta. Verdict = Vegetarian pies, although tasty and possibly healthy are not the thing of which legends are made. \r\n\r\nNed Kelly. Verdict = OMG OMG OMG!\r\nWhile you can easily imagine the first three pies flavour profile you're going to have to try the Ned Kelly. It's a steak pie, with fried egg and cheese and BBQ sauce all in one magical eye-popping pie! Serve any of these pies (except for the vile veggie one) alongside some mushy peas, mashed potatoes and and a cold one and you're golden.\r\n\r\nThey've got big pies to take home and they have little pies that you can eat while you're taking your big pie home. They've really thought of everything.  What a great surprise! I had a delicious beef and cheese pie and some broccoli soup at this tiny place. I definitely recommend.  One of my favourite places to go for a quick bite to eat. They also make a large assortment of frozen pies which are great for taking home and eating later. I highly recommend this place. They have vegetarian pies and meat pies, and their desserts are also excellent.  Ces petites tourti\xc3\xa8res sont bien savoureuses. J'ai essay\xc3\xa9 celle \xc3\xa0 l'agneau au cari et aussi celle au steak et fromage. La salade \xc3\xa9tait fra\xc3\xaeche. Il y a un grand choix de tourti\xc3\xa8res et les desserts ont l'air tr\xc3\xa8s bons. Le service est rapide et sympathique. C\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 ambiance, c'est petit et le d\xc3\xa9cor n'a vraiment rien d'extraordinaire, mais il y a une terrasse qui donne sur l'avenue du Parc, o\xc3\xb9 nous avons mang\xc3\xa9. C'\xc3\xa9tait agr\xc3\xa9able, car en soir\xc3\xa9e la rue n'est pas extr\xc3\xaamement passante. \r\n---\r\nThese little meat pies are tasty. I tried the lamb and curry and also the steak and cheese pies. Salad was fresh. There's a wide variety of meat pies, and desserts look good. Service is fast and friendly. The place is small and the decor is too basic, but there is a patio outside by Avenue du Parc, where we ate. It was nice because the street is not too busy at night.  This is one of those awesome restaurants that comes into your life just as you're looking for something different. Their pies are incredible, with savoury filling and perfectly flaky crust and their desserts are just as great, really inspired creations. \r\n\r\nI usually go for the 3-for$40 deal on the family-size pies and a few highlights are definitely the green chili thai chicken pie, the butter chicken pie and the chili con carne. The sweet potato curry and classic potato top get honourable mentions, too. Finishing off the meal with a TimTam Tiramisu adds something really unique and decadent to the whole experience, too. \r\n\r\nIf you've never been, go!  Best meat pie in town!! They may seem a bit expensive at first but they are very filling and flavorful. The butter chicken pie is the bomb! Top that with a super friendly service from the lady at the counter.  What more could you want?  I visited this bakery last summer during our foodie trip through Montreal. I ent in on a whim when we were very hungry. IT BLEW MY MIND! We returned home to Toronto to go on a pie rampage trying to find something close to Ta Pies. Toronto is now going through a aussie pie love phase, 4 restaurants opened in the last year. As delicious as they are, they do not even compare. I can't wait to return to Montreal, not just for the croissants and poutine, but for ta pies.  I write all my reviews based on a student budget:\r\n\r\nWent with a friend and we got two pies for about $14, the veggie one was superb, the beef with cheese was okay. Certainly didn't fill us up so it felt more like an appetizer.  Not the best meat pies out there, but they're pretty decent. They're great to take away and eat on the mountain.\r\n\r\nDon't get conned into buying the Tim Tams from here, though, because you can get them for half the price at Loblaws!  I love the food here! I am particularly fond of the butter chicken meat pie, coupled with a ginger beer. One of my favourite places in Montreal!  4.5\\/5\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant and welcome surprise that we happened by Ta Pies after the restaurant we\'d originally planned to go to for lunch was closed for the entire week (with little notice). I say their loss and our absolute gain! \r\n\r\nWalking down avenue du Parc towards Mont Royal, I recognized Ta Pies from a long time ago, having previously bookmarked it in my head (but inevitably forgetting about it, as one would expect). I wouldn\'t have bookmarked it in my head if it wasn\'t good, so I told my partner, hey, why not? We were due for a big dinner before 6, so what seemed like a casual, light lunch seemed like a really good idea.\r\n\r\nThe space is small and packed! First impression, let\'s see - the owners have accents from the land down under; Milo & Tim Tams are for sale; plus Hugh Jackman is in a picture (with the owners) on the wall. Yup, it\'s as authentic as they come! \r\n\r\nMy partner and I had the following warm single-portioned pies to start: the butter chicken, which packed plenty of meat and is currently my partner\'s favourite; and the steak and mushroom (which is less flavourful than the butter chicken and a bit drier, but still delicious in its own right). \r\n\r\nBecause the space is pretty tight - we had to wait a bit before we got a spot, and even when we did end up seated by the bar seats near the entrance, we had to make sure we weren\'t blocking anybody (to the washroom in the back). In that sense, it\'s probably best to take these pies to go.\r\n\r\nFor around $7 a pie, they were pretty filling and definitely good value. The pie crust is light and buttery & the filling packs a punch in flavour! Pretty damn good pies! We were sorry we didn\'t have a cooler in the back to take some of the frozen pies back home to Ottawa (a mistake we won\'t make again, I assure you), so we did the next best thing.\r\n\r\nWe took out another two pies to go: another butter chicken and the lamb rogan josh, which is my personal favourite (as it has a bit of a kick, but not too spicy). \r\n\r\nIt didn\'t end up being a "light" lunch, but it sure was tasty! No regrets; we\'ll be back (and with a cooler next time!)  Amazing pies! Even more delightful desserts!!!\r\n\r\nThe pies are pre-made and reheated prior to serving, the fillings are generous, tasty, and the pie crusts are mind-blasting.\r\n\r\nI really love the concept of having desserts in a cup, very convenient for on-the-go. I had the Sherry Trifle, and wish there was slightly less alcohol; not too sweet and the texture was perfect.\r\n\r\nA real hidden gem in Montreal, wish more people knew about this place!  Hole in the wall place - but don't let that deceive you. Australian\\/New Zealand comfort food done to perfection. Perfect, I mean PERFECT pastry crust. Done right. We had a side of veggies ( outstanding flavors! ) And 2 curry hand pies\r\n Lamb curry and vegetable curry. The lamb curry pie was to die for! Outstanding - just perfect flavors and mix of spices.. if we were staying longer in Montreal, we'd come back.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Mount Royal. Great place to pop into after a hike in the park.  Oooooooh.. I\'m a 29yo Australian who hasn\'t lived there since he was 8, but have visited. So I have a childhood attraction to that Australian taste.\r\n\r\nI walked in here today after work, next to the park, and was thrilled to see they not only had pies, but Australian products! Vegemite, Cherry Ripe, etc. They also have Lemingtons etc. Which was amazing to find because I usually get people to bring this stuff to me in their suitcases! :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, my wife and I ordered two pies to eat there, not to go. Mine steak\\/cheese, and hers a vegetarian. And they were lovely. The pastry was super yummy just like good Aussie pies, and filling was good too. Not exactly the same (not better\\/worse, just different) but still really nice.\r\n\r\nI\'ll definitely stop here every now and then for a casual pie to go as I walk through the park down to Sherbrooke.\r\n\r\n(Note: Australian pies etc aren\'t "cuisine" in Australia, they\'re just a common fast food, like poutine. And it\'s not so much the pie that is the dish, but more the Australian way of eating it ie: on the go, with a handheld container etc, or at a football game. Either way, there\'s a special rich taste in them that these guys get right. :))  Pie is easily my all-time favorite food. Before visiting Ta Pies I had never had Australian-style pie, so I was determined to pay Ta Pies a visit during my stay in Montreal. I ordered the steak and mushroom pie and my friend ordered the butter chicken. Both were tasty, but the butter chicken was definitely the way to go. I thought that my steak and mushroom pie was missing something, it was just a little bland. Maybe adding cheese would have helped! Regardless, both pies had buttery, flaky crusts. One pie each was a satisfactory lunch for the two of us, making Ta Pies a good bang for your buck. The shop is pretty tiny, but is decorated nicely. A must-visit lunch option while in Montreal.  I was looking for somewhere to have tourtiere in Montreal, and this restaurant came up.  It's a pretty small restaurant, and pretty casual. It took me a few minutes to find this restaurant, but I tend to get lost easily, especially when traveling. I got the basic beef. The filling was delicious and savoury, and the pastry was nice and flaky. I'll have to keep this restaurant in mind for the next time I'm in Montreal. It was well worth the stop.  \xc3\x80 la lecture des avis, je leur conc\xc3\xa8de que des sentiments synonymes. Au comptoir, d'un d\xc3\xa9cor sans g\xc3\xaane de traits peu probants, mon regard indiscret paresse \xc3\xa0 d\xc3\xa9cider. 'Un Ned Kelly!' que je r\xc3\xa9pond \xc3\xa0 la jeune fille. Quoique intangible, elle remarqua le point d'exclamation quit traine la fin de ma phrase. J'avais bien h\xc3\xa2te de le go\xc3\xbbter. \r\n\r\nUn feuillet\xc3\xa9 soumis \xc3\xa0 ses liaisons de tant de beurre. Un mijot\xc3\xa9 de tomates et un oeuf cuit dure. Se veut ainsi un genre de spaghetti \xc3\xa0 nu de p\xc3\xa2te distingu\xc3\xa9 d'un salut ovo. \xc3\x80 la fois riche et trich\xc3\xa9 d'un peu de sucre, l'oeuf est \xc3\xa9trange en bouche. Mais c'est un compliment affirm\xc3\xa9!  Simply the best meat pies in town it also happen to be Australian. How could you go wrong?  Crazy amazing. Could cost three times the price! Fantastic. Great clean food for an amazing price! Rich delicious savory meat pies. Wish I could cook this well!!!  How can you go wrong with $3 dos Equis draft & $5 French dip sandwich on Wednesday.  Yummy! \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is lacking, not much has been changed since changing hands from\r\nRTO's. \r\n\r\nThe service was excellent, I will be back for sure.  This place sucks an egg! No smoking on an outside patio wtf! Slow service, this isn't Scottsdale people , get with it!  Every school has their local bar or pub that everyone goes to to binge drink after exams, regardless of how good or bad they are...This is Midwestern\'s! Haha. Even though they are now known as the Australian, we still call it by their original name RTO\'s. The beer and mixed drinks are cheap (compared to like 15 bucks a drink where I\'m from!) and they have nightly drink specials. I can see how people are disappointed by their "Australian" menu... truth is the menu did not change much from their original menu except for the addition of a few items. Love their nachos, duck fat fries, sliders, and asian\\/orange sauce wings. Don\'t order the onion rings, you will be disappointed! I will continue going here until 2016... when I graduate and move back to California!  You looking for a sports bar? Holy cow, tv's galore, five sound systems! Great bar! Food was very good, hot, flavorful and plentiful. Glad we didn't take some of the reviews to heart, we would have missed out! This is the new place to watch any sport! Found out a guy from Australia opened it, not to decorate it like Australia ,but for a great sports bar. They have great beer prices too! 25 oz for $3.99.  Horrible!  Bought a Groupon to try this place and went in tonight.  We sat ourselves (just like the sign said) and waited.  Waited and waited and waited.  18 minutes later a very nice woman came out and noticed we were sitting at a table with no drinks,  no menus,  no tableware or napkins.  Just sitting.  She asked us if we needed anything and our reply was to ask for a menu. .... \r\nTwo other couples came in and waited and subsequently left without being acknowledged at all.  We ordered a dr pepper and a Fosters.  We got a diet coke and the fosters.  She dribbled the beer down my leg and onto the floor but didn't notice it.  I discreetly wiped it off my pant leg and smiled. .. She brought menus and we never saw her again.  We ended up leaving $4 on the table and leaving without so much as a word from anyone there.  My Groupon was a waste and we will never go back.  Anyone wanna buy it? ?????  I'm writing this as an update to my last review.  Since my last update,  they brought back karaoke and the drink specials, for which I am happy and grateful. They have also allowed smoking on the back patio again. The bar is still bland, however,  and the only thing on the menu that excites me are the fish tacos. They are the bar tender's personal recipe (kudos to the owners for putting an employee's recipe on the menu) and fantastic.  The wings are also rather good with fries but thats about it. This place still feels like its rolling further and further downhill and I can't help but to think the owners didn't know what they were doing when they bought it. I was there this past Sunday and spent the evening with a whole 6 people,  3 of which came with me and one I believe worked there but was off the clock. Rumor has it that this place won't survive a few more months and that saddens me but its not the same place it was as RTOs and probably shouldn't stick around.  Hopefully whatever goes there next is more successful and better managed. \r\n\r\nPS.: Calling Restaurant Impossible like another person said is actually a good idea. Maybe try it.  Love the tvs at almost every table. Wasn't impressed with there food. The Ruben was alittle dry but all and all not a terrible place.  Don't waste your time... this place wreaks of failure and dirty mop water. Seriously, it smells bad.\r\nI went here once when it was RTO's and realized then that it wasn't worth it, but saw that the name had changed, so we decided to try it again. \r\n\r\nNow how does that old saying go? Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... you get the idea.\r\n\r\nHappy hour specials were a joke. $1 off overpriced well, wine and draft. Umm, no thanks. Food specials were about the same $1-2 off a couple of crap-petizers. We tried the potato skins which were - Ehh. Pretty thin slices of potato, but there were about 10 of them for the HH price of $6.\r\n\r\nThe place was dead and I only saw two people working ( both bartenders), so I cant say much about the service. The nearest bartender had to cover our table, so she didn't make it by that often, but the extra star is for her valiant attempt to provide adequate service.\r\n\r\nI know two things are certain; it wont be there long and, I wont be back.  A little slice of Australia in Arizona. Had an awesome time watching the All-Star game there. Great food at a great price! Can't wait for my next sausage roll and meat pie fix (and the duck fat fries weren't too bad either). \r\n\r\nI don't understand how this place gets a bad wrap on Yelp. If you're looking for a quick drink out in Glendale, this is a great place with an awesome selection of Aussie wines!  The Australian, wtf?! R.T. O'Sullivan's was way better food. This limited menu is crap, I won't be coming back.  been visiting The Australian AZ since October of 2013. Good drinks and the food is enjoyable. I am concerned that it seems very empty some nights. Even on a Saturday during NFL playoffs the bar was half full. I'd suggest bringing in a live band on the weekends to jazz it up. I'm fearful the bar wont last another few months if it doesnt pick up soon.  I dont even want to give this restaurant a single star...the service was terrible....we sent our food back not once but twice...and never ended up getting a meal...the manager didn't seem to concerned at how bad the food and service were...we will never ever be back and we would never recommend this to someone...can't imagine that they will be open very long  Food is good but the service needs work. The one manager with the beard deserves a raise or promotion because he literally was doing everything from taking orders to bussing and cleaning tables and making drinks and he seemed to be the only manager there. Kudos to him!  I came in becaue I work around the corner and I always used to come in for lunch. Had the French dip or should i say a bread sanwhich. It would have been nice if the food came to me atleast warm. And if they are going to serve full size sandwiches probably is a good idea to put enough meat in there so you don feel like your just eating bread. I'm going to have to pick a news lunch place.  Ever since RTO left, this place went downhill. Food and service are terrible.  We just had a birthday party for a friend of ours there. We introduced new people to the establishment that enjoyed the food. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable on the food and menu items. Duck fat fries are the way to go. Roo sliders are still good. It was just a great experience for everyone.  Daytime drinking, and I was one of five people in the bar and I felt like I was an inconvenience to the bartender.  The bathroom smelled weird, like a mix of sewage and cheap men's cologne.  I don't know what has changed since it was rto's, but it is  a downgrade.  A friend and I were driving by and decided to stop in and check out the place.  Glad we did.  We sat at the bar and ordered beer and burgers.  3.00 Fosters, a friendly bartender who had our names down in 5 minutes flat, and tasty burgers!  Lots of TVs around and the Suns beat the Thunder, so it was a great time!  This place is an absolute joke... Went here with 6 friends, sat at the table, 25 minutes later: no waitress. I ask to speak to the manager who is dressed in jeans and a T-Shirt with a hat on, who says "ok".... Just "ok". No apology, no "what can I get for you", nothing. Get a waitress, 10 minutes later two of us have water, no one else has anything. 15 minutes later she walks up and says "sorry we are out of cups".... So we leave. \r\n\r\nWorst service in a really long time. Will NEVER go back.  The service has improved, the patio is excellent with 6 tvs and 20 oz big beers for 3.99.  The nachos and burgers are huge and great.  The wings were excellent. You can have regular fries or duck fat fries with homemade dipping sauces.  You can sit in a booth with your own tv for sporting events or ntn trivia.  Despite poor reviews, this is still 1 of 2 bars showing WWE (the other in Mesa). I was impressed w the number of tvs bc they're everywhere even with sound outside.\r\n\r\nFirst experience: Service was a little slow. Not enough staff, but those here were working hard. I waited between beverages which is a negative. Food wasn't good. We got traditional fries that were not all the way cooked, drenched in oil, soggy\\/flimsy. They came w ketchup and 2 sauces. We picked house made garlic aioli and chipotle. Big mistake on anything made in house. See THE BEST For more on sauces.\r\n\r\nNext several experiences: pizza-thumbs down. Reuben (why did I order Irish fare here) had processed Swiss singles but crispy corn beef, tasty thousand island and dry sour kraut on well toasted marble rye. Pickle was the highlight but fries have seriously improved. Burger-just okay. Cooked as ordered. Bacon was extra crispy and again the highlight.\r\n\r\nEarlier last year and this year (2014) There was a special menu for the WWE event which did feature a cheeseburger and fries for $7.99. There were healthy and vegetarian options with the most expensive item being $13.99. \r\n\r\nNow there's a very reasonable regular menu and no gratuity on PPV nights.\r\nThe menu pricing seems strange. Some items are $2, $3, $10, while others are $8.98, $5.50, $7.59, or $0.95. \r\n\r\nHow do you get the beers so cold? I watched the bar tender pull the mugs, already full of beer from the cooler. Then she topped them off to give a head. Creepy or ingenious? UPDATE: haven't seen that since summer. Beers are still cold and bar staff is tops. They're on it, at least the awesome blonde behind the bar.\r\n\r\nIf I lived nearby I could see this as a more regular place. Definitely live no cover for PPV.\r\n\r\nTHE BEST: they are masters of sauce...ranch, pepper, all kinds. Give it a go.  Been here a few times. Drinks are not really good. Service is great.\r\n\r\nTried a few of the cocktails, they tasted good, but were lacking in EtOh. Had to get a few extra to get the job done.  Disappointing, very inconsistent, appears there is no or very pour management, no systems...I was hoping this place would be a place to go. Oh yeah...there is casino gaming, poker tables...anything to make money...won't be eager to spend money here again.  A few of my friends really like coming here, but I am not really that thrilled with the place. The food is OK. I consider this place a little nicer than a typical dive bar. I guess you get what you pay for.  You know how Outback Steakhouse has boomerangs, didgeridoos and Foster's posters on the wall and NOTHING the least bit Australian on the menu? I've got news for you folks, if you ever go to Australia and ask for a Bloomin' Onion they'll look at you like you're crazy.\r\n\r\nThe Australian is the exact opposite. There's nothing anywhere in the place that would make me think they had anything to do with Australia. And the place is DEFINITELY a sports bar because there are TVs everywhere. So if you're looking for a place to catch a game I don't think you'll go wrong here.\r\n\r\nI hear that they're trying to get Boag's in here which would be awesome....even better if they can get something from Cascade. On my first visit I settled for a Boomer Lager....$4 for a big one....can't beat that. \r\n\r\nTheir menu has a picture of Wagga Wagga on the front. My former boss was from Wagga and having been to Australia several times, I started to feel a bit nostalgic. In addition to your typical pub fare, the menu has some actual Aussie pub grub: meat pies, sausage rolls and 'roo sliders. I had a sampler which consisted of two sausage rolls and a meat pie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Served with duck fat french fries it was too much food really. They also have lamingtons on the menu and Tim Tams for your sweet tooth. \r\n\r\nIf nothing else, I consider their menu a welcome departure from most other sports bars whose menus have little to distinguish themselves from one another. \r\n\r\nThe patrons are all a fun, lively crowd so I enjoyed my first visit here. I agree with some of the reviews that the service is pretty lacking. The very nice man who appeared to be the bar manager did his best to fill in the gaps so hats off to him. But the rest of the staff seems to need more training.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a lot of people are still smarting and lamenting the demise of RTO's. This new venue is definitely very much a work in progress and they have a long way to go. They need to do something about the decor and really add some down under atmosphere and they need to train up their staff to be more attentive.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I hope that The Australian picks up and becomes something. It deserves a chance just for offering something different. The place has a lot of potential and I think smoothing over a lot of rough edges just might do the trick.\r\n\r\nI look forward to coming back in the future to a packed house to watch some Aussie Rules football or Rugby while downing something from Cascade (PLEASE????)  First off I want to say I really like burger king. I believe this may be the worst BK I have ever been to. I have eaten there 4 times now. Every time I received cold food. The last time my burger felt like it was just pulled out of a cooler. At least the prior times they were room temperature. I took the burger back and spoke with the manager about it. He said that he would fix it, his solution was to throw it into the microwave. I thought this was unbelievable. Every employee I had encountered acts as if waiting on a customer is a bother. I was able to consider the first couple visits as a fluke. however after seeing how the manager solves customer issues I realize there is no hope of receiving quality food or service at this location.  If you come here during lunch, plan to spend at least 30 minutes waiting in line to order  Summary: Excellent service and surprisingly good food.\r\n\r\nCraving some fast food one evening before a Walmart trip, I stopped by this Burger King at around 10 pm. I wasn\'t confident about the hours found on Google Places, which listed a closing time of 11 pm, but I assumed that the drive-thru would at least still be open. (Burger King\'s website, unfortunately, doesn\'t list hours for its restaurants, so customers need to either call or guess.)\r\n\r\nI first pulled into the drive-thru and rolled down my window. After a few seconds of looking at the menu board, I decided to back out. Since I had an old receipt with a survey code, I decided I\'d rather first check to see if the dining room were open to make it easier to place an order with the survey receipt. The promotion allowed for either a free Whopper or a free Original Chicken sandwich with the purchase of any size drink and fries.\r\n\r\nWhen I pulled out of the drive-thru lane and into the parking area, the front door of the restaurant swung open, where the manager and one of his employees stood looking out at me. I parked in a space and as my window was down already, I asked them if the restaurant was still open. The manager said with a smile that the drive-thru was open till midnight. He seemed relieved that I had asked, since he and the employee had probably watched me on video backing away from the drive-thru and were understandably suspicious of my awkward back-up job.\r\n\r\nI told them thank you and pulled into the drive-thru, ordering a Whopper, an Original Chicken Sandwich, a medium drink, and a large fries, which came out to be $9.52. Once I pulled up to the second window, a friendly employee handed me my drink. I then gave him my receipt with the survey discount code. He plugged in some numbers in the POS screen but had to ask the manager for help, since he had probably already put in my original order. The manager gave me back my receipt and told me that he had given me the 2 for $5 Whopper and Chicken Sandwich deal, explaining that it would come out to be cheaper than if I had used the survey code to get an extra sandwich.\r\n\r\nI hesitated, reconfirming the price of $9.52. The manager noticed my trepidation and asked me how much had I been looking to spend, telling me that he could adjust my order according to my budget. I told him around $7.00. I asked him to maybe take off the Whopper. He said it might work out to keep both sandwiches with a medium fries instead of a large. He did some plugging around on the POS screen, while I added that I could downgrade to a small fries if I needed to.\r\n\r\nHe ended up getting my order down to a value fries and a small drink, without having to take away any of the sandwiches, for $7.15, asking if that were okay with me. I responded that they had already given me a medium drink, and he said, "Don\'t worry about it. It\'s on us." He then confirmed that I had been given a straw.\r\n\r\nThe employee took my credit card, and about 10 seconds after giving it back to me, handed me my bag of food, told me there was ketchup in the bag, thanked me with a smile, and wished me a good evening.\r\n\r\nAfter opening my bag in the Walmart parking lot, I discovered that along with my two sandwiches there was a large fries inside. (Recall that they had cut my order down to a value size.) That was certainly a bonus, having only paid for the value size. The fries were a bit on the salty side but definitely tasted better than the limited-edition crinkle-cut Satisfries that I had at another Burger King location.\r\n\r\nOn opening my Whopper box, I discovered that my sandwich was surprisingly well-made, presented very neatly in one of those origami-looking half-wrappers and as thick and tidy-looking as a Whopper would look in a promotional photo). My first bite was excellent, as I could immediately taste the onion and the charbroiled taste of the beef. From start to finish, this Whopper didn\'t disappoint, and while eating it I was reminded of why I\'ve always found the Whopper to be better-tasting and of better value than its counterparts at McDonald\'s and Wendy\'s.\r\n\r\nMy Original Chicken Sandwich was the same as it\'s always been since my childhood. Since it\'s presented in a full wrapper rather than a box and doesn\'t have as many toppings (only shredded iceberg lettuce and mayonnaise), it didn\'t have the chance to shine like the Whopper in its presentation, but it still tasted just as I would expect it to--satisfying.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was extremely pleased with my visit to this Burger King. Most people don\'t expect great service and food from a fast food restaurant, but sometimes there are surprises out there. This Burger King location is one of those surprises, and I\'ll definitely be back when I\'m out that way on Route 30 and craving some BK.  There is nothing spectacular about this place.  I think that Burger King could use one of those remodels that Wendys is going through.  I don't think I have been to a Burger King that doesn't look like the late 90s or early 2000s.\r\n\r\nThe one good thing about this location is that it is right off of Rt. 30, an easy place to pull off, pick up some food and continue on your way.  Albeit there is another one up the road about two miles, but that one is further off the road.\r\n\r\nFood is the norm, and as they say, you can have it your way.  Stopped in after work and ordered a veggie burger and large fry without mayo. Then I pulled up to pay. The girl who took my order and the married employee she was working with were flirting the whole time on her phone and barely said a word to me when I pulled up. After about a five minute wait, I received my burger. I did not receive the toppings I ordered on my burger so pulled  BACK around to tell the girl at the window. She didn't even so much as apologize and asked what I ordered again, so they could correct my already-made burger, rather than prepare me a new one. After they fixed my burger and I checked for spit, I became infuriated at the service and meal I just pid $6.40 for. \r\n\r\nSo I called in and spoke with the manager, John, who apologized tremendously, told me he would talk to his employee, and assured me a free meal for the inconvenience. If it weren't for him, this review would easily have one star. Step up ya game, Lincoln BK!  Rude manager. I asked for a bk stacker and instead they gave me a bacon cheese burger. I told them it wasn't a bk stacker, they said they would fix it. But they gave me the same thing. The rapper was half open.  4 for pies, 2 for value\r\nThe moment you walk buy, the store is fragrant with buttery goodness.\r\nThey have really good pies, pie crust are nice and flakey. Chicken pie filling should be what all chicken pies aim to be: chicken chunks are moist with a good mix of veggies; just enough sauce to soften pieces of the crust but not make the whole thing soupy. I also tried the minced meat one, it was still tasty, but completely eclipsed by its chicken counterpart. \r\nA huge complaint on the size of these delicious pies, any adult cannot possibly be filled by a baby pie the size of a palm - an effin tiny Asian lady\'s palm! What portion size are they used to eating in the down under? And the audacity for they to charge a cheap McDs value meal for this little food?\r\n"Simple salad" was miserable, basically a store bought spring mix with olive oil and balsamic. Their meals come with sausage rolls \\/ spinach & feta rolls, which are decent too...still ain\'t filling tho.  REALLY impressed with the flakiness of the crust throughout the entire duration of my meal. \r\n\r\nThe MASALA pie was described with a spicy warning but no heat was detectable for me. The chickpeas and eggplant were tasty though. Not terribly saucy\\/soggy so it was akin to a massivo fusion samosa\r\n\r\nThe TRADITIONAL AUSSIE was well seasoned and although ground meat, some pieces of meat were quite chunky and toothsome. Well seasoned and enjoyable but perhaps forgettable. \r\n\r\nThe kanga box is $10.50 and comes with a pie + small roll (sausage rolls or spinach and cheese roll) + simple salad, mashed potatoes, or mushy peas. The simple salad is straight up just spinach and dressing but offers a balance to all the butteriness of the pie crust. \r\n\r\nJust because of the heaviness and pretty priciness I don't see myself having it all that often but def a diff option for lunch in the financial district.  I was hungrily walking around and noticed a sign for Kanga pies... I'll admit I was initially interested in possibly eating a kangaroo meat pie. \r\nUltimately I went in and stuck to the vegetarian offerings they had. I ordered the creamy zucchini pie and in all honesty... I devoured it quickly because it was so incredibly delicious. \r\nThe flakey buttery exterior was ideal and the filling was full of flavour and top notch seasoning. \r\n\r\nI would gladly eat another pie this instant! The only thing holding me back from seconds (and my five star rating) is the slightly expensive price for the sort of small pies.  Glad Kanga is now available right in the PATH, making it a good lunch idea. Their Australian meat pies are small portioned, and filled with delectable minced beef\\/chicken\\/veggie in many gravies\\/sauces and may also include cheese (e.g. the Kiwi Classic). Prices are high for such a small pie but the quality is good with a flaky crust made using real butter.\r\n\r\nThey do have a combo deal which is $10.50 for a meat pie, a small sausage or spinach roll, and a side. Compared to buying the three individually, you save a few bucks and would be full compared to buying just a pie. Buying a meat pie alone is more like a snack, especially since the filling could do with more meat (but hard considering the pastry is already small).\r\n\r\nWill be back.  I popped in this little shop in commerce court out of pure curiosity, no offence to my Aussie brothers and sisters, but it's not a common occurrence to see a food shop devoted to Australian food. To be honest, beyond Vegemite. i didn't know much else about Australian food, nor did i think it would be any different than north american food. \r\n\r\nThis place however, specializes in Aussie meat pies, the guy behind the counter suggested the Canadian style pie, and i also bought the Kiwi (New Zealander) pie, i have to say they were pretty damn great, the pastry was flaky, crispy and buttery, and the filling was superb, the Kiwi pie had minced meat and cheddar. and the canadian had big chunks of steak, canadian bacon and some veggies. The guy behind the counter was absolutely right, the canadian was AWESOME!! \r\n\r\nThese pies are definitely worth trying. However a little on the expensive side for such a small pie ($6.85) as 1 is a snack size and 2 could be a small meal. Really $4.50 to $5.00 would be more reasonable, this could prove challenging for this business in the long run with this high price point, definitely over valued. I would safely bet that they could do better business with a lower price point. But i digress.. Overall i was really pleasantly surprised at how good these pies are, they are quite delicious. They also sell them uncooked so you can take them home and make them later or freeze them. I will definitely be returning to try the other meat pies they have, well except the zucchini one, because, well it's Zucchini and  we just don't get along... They use high quality ingredients as well, including delicious sausages from Sanagan's in their sausage rolls. I highly suggest trying this place out, Unique and delicious :)  Came here on a whim, my friend and I were hungry. We ordered the butter chix and a cheddar chive scone, as the price for one pie was pretty pricey ($6.85). The pie itself is about maybe 3.5 inches wide. \r\n\r\nCrust was on point, filling was great  All butter crust, and being a baker, I know how important it is to nail the crust.\r\n\r\nScone was a little lack luster, they also didn't have anything to warm it up for us. \r\n\r\nFilling was good - not too rich and just the right amount.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would maybe adjust is the prices ($$) $6.85 is too much to charge for a personal sized pie IMO.\r\n\r\nGood, I'd like to come back and try the traditional meat pie.  For some reason, before I actually looked into it, I thought these pies were full of kangaroo meat (I know... d'oh!). Newsflash: they're not. Kanga has a variety of pie options you can pick from, with various filling types. Located in the heart of Commerce Court (at the edge of the Commerce Court Food Court), I've stopped by a couple of times and I've had the Canadian (Steak and Bacon) Pie, Pepper Steak Pie, the Spinach Roll, and the Sausage Roll.\r\n\r\nThe pie crust is fresh and flaky, and not too oily, which is great. Out of everything I've tried so far, I enjoyed the Canadian (Steak and Bacon) best. Flavourful meat, flaky pastry crust - a good combination. I thought the Spinach Roll was okay, but I wouldn't get the Sausage Roll again (the meat was a bit bland).\r\n\r\nOverall, I think you'll find more hits than misses at this place, which is a good thing. They also have lunch specials that come with salads, if you wish. If you come often, you can also take advantage and get a stamp card (for every X number of pies you purchase, you get something free!). Service is also really friendly - I'd come back again!  Buttery, flaky pies. Butter chix (butter chicken) is my go to pie here. Enough for a small lunch when you're not that hungry. Freezer to the right has frozen unbaked pies that you can take home at a discount. \r\n\r\nThe woman who works here is a bit surly and doesn't seem like she wants to be there.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that the map location is WRONG. I already reported it but apparently they couldn't confirm it. This 199 Bay location is at Bay and King, in the PATH.  This is my new favourite lunch spot! The lunch boxes are a great option for a satisfying lunch and afternoon snack. The box includes a pie (zucchini is my fav), salad option (get the Australian) and snack size sausage or spinach roll.\r\nLove that they are now open late for dinner!  This one's located in Commerce Court. One of them...east, west, north...I don't know it's pretty confusing down there for those that don't go frequently.\r\n\r\nPies are served hot. Flaky crust. Lots of filling.\r\nYou can also buy frozen pies home to pop into the oven yourself to consume at your own convenience.\r\n\r\nI ordered a chicken pie and it came with nice chunks of tender chicken with various vegetables.\r\n\r\nAt $7 a pie though, I think it would be better if the pie was larger since it's not enough unless you're just looking for a snack. They have end-of-day special at this commerce court location half an hour before it closes where you can get $5 a pie.  Had a Lunch Box:\r\n\r\nPie (Canadian):\r\nAdequate amount of meat\r\nGood sauce\r\nOverall very tasty\r\n\r\nRoll (Sausage):\r\nSavory\r\nVery good\r\n\r\nSalad:\r\nGreen\r\n\r\nGood place for lunch.  Great for lunch or taking some pies home after work! I love the original and the creamy zucchini!  Small take out restaurant in a strip mall near the corner of St. Clair and Victoria park. No menu or prices posted, j ust have to point and ask. Their meals are super cheap $5 meals that come with a ton of rice and a veggie side. Tried their roti (75 cents a piece). It was thick and chewy and the taste reminded me of a pancake. Ordered their chicken wings. Generous portion, crispy and tasty. For those who remember Pioneer Fried Chicken the wings tasted like they came from there. Then ordered the shrimp curry and the mutton, tasty and surprisingly mildly spiced for a Sri Lankan dish. I would have given it a higher rating but the food wasn't even warm. Better to come  when it first opens up so the food will be hot.  Great takeout place for authentic srilankan\\/Tamil food. It is very affordable. Saturday\\/Sunday 5$ briyani specials are best.  This is literally my favorite food in the city.\r\nI\'ve had Sri Lankan food maybe twice besides Kanga, and it never touched Kanga\'s deliciousness. Most of the staff dont speak English well (see: at all,) and often many of the items they have to offer aren\'t on display. Which is difficult, because ordering sometimes comes down to pointing to what you want (MAKE SURE IT ISNT TRIPE. M.A.K.E. S.U.R.E .. unless you somehow enjoy tripe... In which case I would just recommend digging up some worms and tossing them in hot sauce outside because it would taste similar and be cheaper.) They have different foods on different days (even different times of day)... They often have a mutton (stew?)- YOU MUST EAT THIS. If you like spicey food don\'t heed their warnings that it\'s too spicey (unless you are "white.") It is perfection. If you manage to order the mutton and some biryani, you will be eating my favorite dish in all of Toronto. I can\'t write much more, the place is a mystery, I step in and I walk out with food somehow, and it\'s always an adventure.\r\nIf you\'re willing to step out of your comfort zone and roll some culinary dice, step into Kanga.\r\n\r\nAlso, best of all? Dirt cheap. DIRT. D.I.R.T.\r\n\r\nOh, and finally- it\'s a hole in the wall... A tiny hidden hole in the wall. takeout only.  The place is okay.  I had the butter chix pie.  For one, the price came to about $7.75?  It is on the pricey end.  I doubt I would come here again, it isn't my type of food I would often.  It is a bit heavy.  YUM!!! This place has amazing pies. I have been to the original location but this one is perfect for me to grab a pie and salad during lunch hours or on my way home before I hop on the subway! I love the food and variety of options including sweet treats and the staff are super friendly!!  Another fatty meal but omg is it worth the calories. A big fat yes!  I love the kiwi meat pies from here. Always hot and fresh. It's a little on the pricy side for the portion but it's heavily goodness makes up for it. \r\n\r\nJust then pie itself will set you back around $8 and it's not filling. With the combo itll set you back $12.... still not too filling. Maybe I'm just a big eater but it'll last you till mid day then you'll have to grab a snack.\r\n\r\nThey also sell frozen ones 4 for $24. It takes 45-60 mins to cook... I most likely won't buy those as I have no patience. Anyways a must try but note there's no seating at this location.  Pretty good but on the expensive side given the pie size. I had the traditional pie and it was tasty and flaky. I also tried the curry one but it wasnt as good as the traditional.  Dude, I'm going to have a stroke.\r\n\r\nThis place is ridiculously good and this is the reason I'm going to get fat. Damn.\r\n1 minute walk from my work is definitely not enough for me to work off the fattening delicious pies here. It's a small store and thank goodness there's never really a line. \r\n\r\nThere are two vegetarian options for pies here - a zucchini one and the mates masala - CHICK PEAS!! I love the spicy indian flavours so I definitely go for this one. Let me tell you, the first time I saw this tiny pie, I was like .. wat. How is this going to fill me? ....I was very wrong- definitely very full after this and extremely satisfied. My mind drifted back to the thought of the masala pie for the next few days. \r\n\r\nI don't know why but I had the lunch deal the next time I went, which included a spinach roll and a side. HOLY SHIIAAAAT, the carb overload was insane. I can't deal. I was in a food coma for pretty much the entire afternoon and couldn't breathe for a good 4 days. WORTH IT.\r\n\r\nStaff are super sweet too.\r\n\r\n100% must go back and refrain from eating it every few days.  I tried Kanga pies a while ago at their original location and as soon as I saw them at their new location right outside the St. Andrew subway station (on my way home from work) I got pretty excited! They sell frozen pies for you to bake at home which is perfect for when you just don't want to cook! I love the sausage rolls too!  Aussie meat pie was delicious so is the spinach roll !!! I went there with my MealPal subscription, normally each lunch costs 7 dollar with it. If I paid cash this 2 items would cost around 10 dollars, it is pricey but can be eaten once in a while. It is a small portion but because it is oily it is filling to the stomach. I ate the meat pie with ketchup like recommended and was yummy !!  Delicious! A bit spendy, but a worthwhile treat! I'll be back again, I want to try them all. Pastry layered to perfection.  I now know what an Australian Pie is and what it is not. To my disappointment, these pies are not dessert pies; nevertheless, they are tasty savoury meat pies. The guy running the place was really nice and helpful. There is a nice little place to eat outside too! I would go back sometime.  Yesterday, a friend and I went to the Monkland (NDG) location of the Ta Pies bakery.  This bakery is Australian\\/New Zealand inspired and run by a husband and wife team.\r\n\r\n" "Ta"  (slang down under for thanks alot) is dedicated to producing high quality comfort food with a modern twist on traditional recipes at a reasonable price. Our pies are high quality gourmet versions of southern hemisphere classics as well as some creations of our own and can be purchased hot to eat on the go and cold or frozen to reheat at home. Cold\\/frozen pies also come in family size. Our desserts are all handmade classics with our own personal touch. Our famous flat white coffees and specialty drinks will complete your Ta experience, or maybe some Timtams or a jar of vegemite to take home. " -via their official website.\r\n\r\nMy friend fully enjoyed his beef pie with mashed potatoes and the atmosphere is super cozy.  You can either sit inside surrounded by the amazing aromas or you can sit on the patio outdoors and watch as people walk up Monkland.  You can go to their official website for more menu information and you can also follow them on Facebook.\r\n\r\nI also have to say that it didn\'t hurt to see a picture of the owners with Hugh Jackman hanging on the wall from when he was in Montreal filming Days of Future Past  This restaurant makes the best meat pies ever! I am really sad that this location has closed.  Delicious pies and nice helpful people at the counter.  Perfect food for a little indulgence on the go.  Tasted the butter chicken pie and also the traditional.  Both were great.  I like and will go back.
