yum yum yum!\r\n\r\nWent with a party of four - we were seated immediately. The waitress was quick and polite and answered all of our questions. The owner was really sweet and came over to our table to explain a dish to us since we weren't familiar with burmese food. \r\n\r\nEveryone was really happy with their meals and extra points for so many veggie options! \r\n\r\nDefinitely will be back again!  Loved this place!\r\n\r\nThis was my first time trying Burmese food and I was not disappointed. We went here on a Saturday night and found a table easily. \r\n\r\nWe ordered:\r\n\r\nSplit Pea Fritters: Yumm, it come with a tamarind sauce and some chill flakes on the side. You can add that to your sauce based of your spice level.\r\n\r\nBasa Fish Curry: Superb! This was my favourite dish and I wiped it clean.\r\n\r\nAnother fish curry no. 33: I don't remember that name of that dish but it too was good but not as good as the Basa curry.\r\n\r\nChicken Rice: It was a really unique dish with raisins, nuts, onions, rice and chicken. I thought it would taste like Indian Biriyani but it didn't. Must try at this place!\r\n\r\nKat Kyee Kay: I may have spelt the name wrong but this was a noodle based dish with crushed peanuts, Chinese sausage and vegetables. It was my least favourite dish and I barely ate much of it.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the place is a wonderful lady, she is extremely sweet and welcoming. If you haven't tried Burmese food, this would be a good place to start :)  Really good and not expensive. Very good quality, plates are rich. I was surprised that the owner advice us to order less food because plates are big, this is not common. With lots of people at the restaurant, service may be slower  -BUG EVERYWHERE, DON'T LOOK UP AT THE LIGHTS YOU WILL GAG\r\n-SERVICE TAKES FOREVER, DON'T GO HUNGRY\r\n-BATHROOMS NEED A KEY, ATTACHED TO A DIRTY WOODEN SPOON\r\n-PRICES ARE RIDICULOUS FOR SUCH TERRIBLE QUALITY\r\n-HORRIBLE FOOD, WEAK FLAVOURS\r\n-WHEN THEY CLEAR A TABLE, THEY DO NOT WIPE IT DOWN. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THEY SIMPLY RESET THE FLATWARE AND NAPKINS. \r\nNEVER GOING AGAIN.\r\n\r\nThese reviews have got to be jokes, because there is no way anyone could consider this food to be good by any standard. To begin with, we walked in to the mostly empty restaurant and had to flag down the hostess to be seated. We wanted to be seated near the window, no luck, as that would have meant that she would have had to clean the table off first. So she declined and sat us elsewhere. We then waited for 20 minutes to get a menu. Again, we had to flag down a server in a mostly empty restaurant. She immediately got us a menu, by taking two away from the couple seated near us....WTF. They hadn't even ordered yet. So the four of us had two menus. Oh well, that's ok. We waited another 25 minutes for her to come back and ordered. We got the #10 Glass Noodle Salad, #1 Chickpea Fritters, #17 Chicken Noodle Dish, #27 Beef Curry. The Salad was not glass noodle. It was a strange type noodle similar to spaghetti, the flavours of the salad were mild and almost non existent. Curry, chicken, hardboiled egg, coconut milk, and cucumber with peanuts. But every single component was so watered down it was a joke and the chicken was coated with a mystery ingredient. :P My favourite part was the salad was luke warm so i had no idea if it was supposed to be hot or cold. The beef curry was also a letdown. Very very mild with cheap cuts of beef you could have bounced off the floor. Even the appy was a let down, cheap fritters with a small serving of sauce, COVERED in chill flakes, enough that we gave up on the sauce. I love spice, I'll cover anything in Siracha, but come on it was a joke. My least favourite was the chicken noodle. It had tomato sauce from a can and half cooked noodles. It was served with a side of broth meant to be poured over it, but it was just dried garlic and pepper in a weak stock.\r\nSuch a friggin ripoff  Ate at Ruby last weekend. Every dish we had was stellar. And the service was very nice. Our waiter was a real gentleman.  C'\xc3\xa9tait la proposition d'une amie. Quand j'\xc3\xa9tais arriv\xc3\xa9 sur les lieux, je n'avais pas lu les avis. \r\n\r\nSauf que quand j'ai vu le d\xc3\xa9cor qui ressemblait \xc3\xa0 un restaurant de bouffe cheap, je n'ai pu m'emp\xc3\xaacher de lire les avis avec l'article de La presse. Les avis \xc3\xa9taient plut\xc3\xb4t favorables.\r\n\r\nOn \xc3\xa9tait le 1er juillet, jour f\xc3\xa9ri\xc3\xa9, alors je vais leur laisser un doute sur la qualit\xc3\xa9 m\xc3\xa9diocre du service. Nos verres d'eau \xc3\xa9taient vide. Lorsque j'ai demand\xc3\xa9 d'ouvrir une bouteille de vin, la serveuse a mis l'ouvre bouteille sur la table et est partie. Les plats ne sont pas arriv\xc3\xa9s tous en m\xc3\xaame temps. Le restaurant \xc3\xa9tait \xc3\xa0 moiti\xc3\xa9 plein. \r\n\r\nLa nourriture c'\xc3\xa9tait correcte. Il manquait de go\xc3\xbbt, les saveurs pas assez relev\xc3\xa9s. Les plats \xc3\xa9taient originaux et go\xc3\xbbtaient des plats de cuisine maison, ce qui est bien. J'ai aim\xc3\xa9 les salades. On a essay\xc3\xa9 pas mal toutes les suggestions des autres commentaires et ce qui est bon c'est vraiment les salades. Le reste \xc3\xa9tait bien, mais manquait de saveurs. \r\n\r\nLe prix est tr\xc3\xa8s abordable pour un apportez votre vin.\r\n\r\nJe n'y retournerai pas. Mais je le sugg\xc3\xa9rais comme restaurant apportez votre vin pas cher.  Great traditional spot where you really feel the burmese vibes. Every meal we tried was delicious and tasty. Some were spicy like Shan Kwan Swae (chicken mixed with noodles and veggies).\r\n\r\nThe owner of the place was so friendly and welcoming, almost getting the feeling you have when you're in Asia.\r\n\r\nNow get out of your comfort zone and try something new like this. Especially, it's one of the only burmese spot in MTL.  Yeah...I think the owner lady is crazy...don\'t ever complain or she will flip. She served me cold food and went nuts just because after she brought back a plate of saggy vegetables I asked if she microwaved my food. Quote of the day "Why didn\'t u tell me if u don\'t want me to microwave ur food" "u r gonna sabotage my business" "u just want free food don\'t u""u r only here looking for trouble" "please leave" ----All I\'ve said was "u brought me cold food and after I told you, you microwaved it, do you think its right to do that? " from my experience, the wait is super long, curry was normal. Appetizer is good but overall, the day is ruined because of this restaurant.  Restaurant birman tr\xc3\xa8s bon et simple : nourriture, service et lieu ! \r\n\r\nLa nourriture y est gouteuse et l\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa8re, \xc3\xa0 essayer sur le Boulevard St-Laurent !  Burma\\/Myanmar has finally opened up to the world after decades of relative isolation.\r\nOne of the first things to come out, is of course the food.\r\nThe best way I can describe Burmese food is to try to imagine the freshness of the ingredients like Thai cuisine, the heat of Indian and the exoticness of Indonesian all combined together in a unique way.\r\nThe absolute signature dish here to try is the Tea Leaf Salad. Myanmar is one of only 2 countries in the world that actually eat tea leaves. The Burmese take tea leaves (the same kind you brew in order to drink) and then marinate it in a combination of, I\'m guessing, lime juice, fiery hot chilis and other ingredients. They then use marinated tea leaves along with other ingredients, like peanuts, beans, coriander, chilis, greens to create which is by far, the tastiest and most unique salad I\'ve ever had. This is the sort of stuff you begin dreaming about and as soon as you get home Google the recipe so you can create it at home.\r\n\r\nLet me put it to you this way: There is another Burmese restaurant in San Francisco called "Burma Superstar" and it\'s a 2 hour wait to get in or even pick up food. Guess what their signature dish is as well? \r\nTea Leaf Salad.\r\n\r\nIt\'s not just their salads which will knock your socks off. I ordered the shrimp curry, extra spicy (they adjust the level of heat according to what you ask). They went and actually made it from scratch for me. It came in a beautiful, rich tomato curry broth which included fresh red, hot chilis from the owner\'s garden and fresh coriander\\/cilantro. I cleaned the whole thing off and it was not difficult to do.\r\n\r\nThey have only been open for 2 weeks and they are awaiting several permits but it looks like it will eventually become BYOB and there will be a lunch menu as well.\r\nIn the meantime, go. Try it now. I plan on returning soon to try their tamarind pork.\r\nThe owners are super nice and they aim to please. They are really hoping to expose Montrealers to Burmese cuisine and I really hope they stick around for a while.  I was really excited when I came to this place because of what I read on yelp. I've had some really amazing tea leaf salads in my life (especially in San Francisco), so I was expecting a meal up to that standard. While the tea leaf salad I had here was ok, it wasn't that fresh and mainly consisted of nuts and lots of iceberg lettuce, without much of the diversity of flavor I've come to expect. My friends had a chicken curry dish with rice, which sounded amazing on the menu, but ended up being just ok. This place had so much potential, and while it wasn't horrible, it wasn't really anything special either. I don't think I'll be back.  It's terrific to have a Burmese restaurant in Montreal. Until now I was only able to get a Burmese fix on visits to San Francisco.My favorite part of Burmise cuisine are the salads. These salads are made with many ingredients and are full of a multitude of tastes and textures. The Tea Leaf Salad is a must have. Another must have starter is the Inles Fries. These are made fresh daily and so wonderfully creamy inside, like nothing I've had before. \r\n\r\nWe've tried a number of the main dishes including, the seafood Htamin Kayaw (fried rice), various curries and Kartkyi Kait (noodles) all of which were very enjoyable. However, in my mind the Inles Fries are the star of the menu.\r\n\r\nAll the dishes are great for sharing so go bring some friend and spend the evening sampling the menu.  A great place for a nice meal on St Laurent. They have a lunch promo on 9 dishes (11.50$ including tax) and number 5 is the best noodle dish I've had in a while. I had previously tried the curry and the salad with family, and I remember us all being very satisfied. I remember the tea leaf salad like it was yesterday! It's decently priced when you think about quality\\/authenticity of the food - and the location. Plus, service is super friendly and casual, I was offered free tea for lunch there and enjoyed it just sitting by the window. I will definitely be back.  We picked this on a whim (and while I'd read the reviews for this establishment, I was still unsure). They do not serve alcohol, but it is b.y.o.b (for wines, I suppose, as that's all I saw on the various tables - they will water their plants with the unused portion, which I found equally amusing and rather interesting). The food is great, very flavorful, and deceptively large (considering their portions of rice). They can actually make food spicy (regular spicy, not Montreal spicy (which isn't real spicy)). Their desserts are also sumptuous. The owner had a wonderful chat with us as she cleared our table. However, while the service is attentive and friendly, it is on the slower side.  I want to begin with the fact that I am Burmese and really wanted to like this place.  Most people don't know where Burma is on the map and to find a Burmese restaurant is like gold.  \r\n\r\nMy husband and I ordered his favorite dish Nangyi Thoke -- chicken noodle dish.  Surprisingly the dish was pretty good, but the noodles were just so chewy.  Definitely was not expecting that.  We also ordered the Mohinga Hinyay, which is just the fish soup.  That required a lot more fish sauce, lemon, and spice, but I personally was too timid to ask for those ingredients.  I thought it would be rude to have to dress up their dish as if it was my kitchen.  The last dish was the biggest disappointment, Watthay Hin -- pork and potato curry dish.  No where in Burmese cuisine is pork curry tomato based, where are the spices that make Burmese food different and unique.\r\n\r\nI hope that the owner will one day make her food actually taste like Burmese cuisine.  Ask for some fish sauce, lemon, and red chili pepper -- that might give her a hint to make the dishes a tad bit more authentic.  Wow! This place needs to close shop ASAP. Worst service package complete with dirty table upon arrival, drinks never arrived, took an hour before very bland food came. I really suck at writing and would like to continue. But For real the whole problem is that the owner lady gave zero effort to try to do anything to make the experience better. I believe she doesn't deserve to serve the community at all. Time for a new owner and menu.  Burmese cuisine is a rarity around here, so the recent opening of this restaurant (April) is a welcome addition to Montreal's culinary scene. I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and while the place was busy, we were still able to get  table at the back. I found the restaurant to be bright and very clean, and the tables spread out enough such that you don't end up eyeballing your neighbor's dishes. What can I say? I like my personal space!\r\n\r\nWith so many delicious items on the menu, it was tough to make a decision, but I finally went with the Northern Lights salad, which consists of 24 ingredients. Did I remember to write down those ingredients? No I did not - but I can tell you that there are four types of noodles and papaya in there. This dish was served at room temperature, which was perfect given the crazy heat wave we've been having lately. You have the option of adding meat (chicken, pork or beef) and making the dish as spicy as you like it - just let the waiter know. I really enjoyed the dish - it was very flavorful and the right level of spice for me.  Can't wait to go back and try the infamous tea leaf salad!\r\n\r\nOne thing to mention - the portions are huge so you might want to consider sharing, unless you've got a very large appetite! Considering the very reasonable prices, you are definitely getting your money's worth at this place. My only 'complaint' was that the service was a little slow - but I wasn't in a hurry so no big deal.  Tr\xc3\xa8s bon et frais. Les saveurs sont diff\xc3\xa9rentes, un judicieux m\xc3\xa9lange de chinois et d'indien.  (Belated review: Was here in July)\r\n\r\nI love Burmese food and although there was a fairly long wait it was well worth it \r\n\r\nThe food is great and very authentic and the service is courteous \r\n\r\nJust make sure you have time and aren't in a rush \r\n\r\nI recommend the fermented tea leaf salad  Ruby Burma is an awesome surprise on a rather unpleasant stretch of St Laurent. We ate the fermented tea leaf salad and the catfish chowder. Both were refreshing, filling, and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend both dishes. The prices were great; 30 dollars for the whole meal (two people). To top it all off, the waiter was an absolute sweetheart.\r\n\r\nEvery single menu item looks great here - can't wait to return.  Was visiting Montr\xc3\xa9al for the holidays and this restaurant was one of the few things open on Christmas Eve. The restaurant is not all that enticing from the outside but looks can be deceiving. I am so glad we decided to go in!\r\n\r\nThe food was delicious, fresh, reasonably priced and generous portions. The flavours were amazing. I highly recommend the eggplant dish, the tea leaf salad and the coconut milk rice dessert. If it wasn't socially inappropriate, I would have licked my dish clean! \r\n\r\nIf I am ever back in town I will definitely come back here. The service was excellent - felt truly good about spending my money here.\r\n\r\nDon't miss this place!  Burmese is my favorite cuisine on the face of the earth and I was very excited to stumble upon this place. I'll try to strike a balance between my obvious enthusiasm for Burmese food and my perhaps unrealistic standards -- I tend to compare every Burmese place to Burma Superstar in San Francisco, and Burma Supertar Ruby Burma is not. \r\n\r\nThe tea leaf salad was indeed delicious. Not the best I've ever had, but it was quite good. If you're new to Burmese, make absolutely sure you order this dish. The shan noodles had good flavor, too, and were appropriately pungent. The BYO wine policy is lovely.\r\n\r\nI gather this place is newish. I hope they make it and I hope they continue to improve. The staff and service were very nice, attentive, and eager, but it seemed like a little something went wrong with everything. Our appetizer could be picked up by a hair cooked into it (these things happen, I know, and they kindly replaced it). After clarifying that the shan noodles were vegetarian and that we needed all our food vegetarian, the noodles were served with chicken soup. They forgot about the tea leaf salad and so had to ask us about it after we had already eaten the other things, so it was more or less a delayed salad dessert. Again, they were very nice, but not a great sign that this was how things went on a Friday night when the place was nearly empty. Hard to imagine what a busy night would be like. Nevertheless, these kinks can easily be worked out and I hope they are. The restaurant has a lot of potential.\r\n\r\nFinally, one more recommendation in case the restaurant looks at these reviews. A slightly expanded repertoire of Burmese dishes on the menu might go a long way. In particular, samusa soup would be a great add, and it would be nice if coconut or saffron rice were available with the main courses. But of course, this is my Burma Superstar standard creeping in.  Really delicious. Although I'm not a connoisseur of Burmese food, this all tasted great and I am keen to return.  Came here on a Saturday night with friends. The woman who served us ( I am assuming is the owner) was super warm and very friendly. I felt very welcome and taken care of. The food was delicious too. I ordered the Noodles In Fish Soup (#16). I would definitely come back here. Next time I will try the Burmese Biryani  In Montreal for the F1 and saw the listing on Yelp.  Decided to try it.  Our first time trying Burmese food.  The restaurant is clearly a work of love for the owners.  \r\nThe  food was excellent.  The Tea Leaf salad, Northern Light Salad, Shrimp curry and the Rice with Chicken (loosely described as biryani) were superb.  The Khaus Wey (sp?), chicken, noodles in coconut milk broth was ok.  \r\nThe crunch and various flavors in the two salads made you want to have more to discover and identify what you were tasting. The shrimp curry was subtly spiced.  We had it made chilli hot but the other spicing was very subtle. It had no coconut, but tomatoes, tamarind, onion, ginger, garlic.  It was so good that we ordered some for dinner the next day.   The chicken rice had onions, raisins and nuts - a real nice complement for the shrimp.  \r\nPrices were very reasonable. Service was very friendly although slow.  They just opened and this is their first experience in the restaurant business, so some of the mechanics need fine tuning.  The owners who cook, wait, bus, etc. opened this with the hope of exposing folks to their cuisine and culture.  One thing that came through strongly was their hospitality and the flavors in their food.  \r\nWe will definitely be back when we next come to Montreal.  This first visit left us wanting more.  Ruby Burma is a gem! Just opened in April 2013, it is the first and only Burmese restaurant in Montreal. When my partner and I walked in we had no idea what Burmese food would taste  like but we decided to be adventurous and try something new. \r\n\r\nWe were greeted by two very friendly owners who then rushed to cook us dinner from scratch! \r\n\r\nThe food was delicious, somewhere at the crossroads between India, China, Thailand. We tried four dishes: \r\n\r\n1. The Green Tea Leaf Salad is famous Burmese appetizing dish featuring pickled tea leaves. The salad has a unique texture, crunchy crispy and nutty, with an assortement of beans intersperesed and a house special dressing made of lime and fish sauce. \r\n2. Baya Kyaw is a fritter of course split pea mixed with Burmese curry spices, served with dipping sauce ( fresh tamarind, ginger garlic...). These were very fun to nibble on. \r\n3. Ah Thoke Son or Northern Light Salad is great for vegetarians and boasts a mix of 24 ingredients including 4 types of noodles, green papaya, tofu, onions, and a tamarind dressing. It was served in room temperature and it is delicious- but this is HOT and if you need it toned down to suit your palate, be sure to ask.  \r\n\r\n4. Chicken curry- was very interesting- usual suspect ingredients, onion, ginger and garlic, and light tomato based sauce. But tasted nothing like Indian or Thai curries. A very unique flavour. \r\n\r\nAmbiance was slightly loud being right St. Laurent, but we didn't mind. With every bite on these new and exciting dishes, we felt like we in some urban centre in Myanmmar. \r\n \r\nOverall, a fantastic experience! I will be back to support this new business and help this unique cuisine flourish in Montreal.  Had a very enjoyable curried tamarind pork - asked for it quite spicy and they delivered.  Very friendly owners of the restaurant, I wish them lots of success.  The owner was friendly and helpful. The food was delicious, authentic, and not overly expensive. Can't wait to come back here!  Ho-hum. What a varied couple of experiences we had here.\r\n\r\nThe first time my partner and I visited Ruby Burma I swore that it was the first time I had ever said "there\'s a party in my mouth" and meant it. Honest to goodness, the tea leaf salad is nothing compared to anything I\'ve EVER tried. If you\'ve never tried Burmese food, get on it, NOW! We were even able to go grab a bottle of vino to match our meal since it\'s BYOB (and the SAQ is across the street!)\r\nThat time the service was a bit slow- but honestly nothing to think twice about.\r\n\r\nThrilled about the food the first time round\' I decided I would bring a group of my girlies to kick off our ladies night. I suppose I jynxed the affair since I talked the place up so much- it took us over two hours (we were a table of five) to eat. By the time we even ordered we had already polished off the first bottle of wine; the waitress informed us it would take about twenty minutes to get our food since the cook was alone and they were preparing a large takeout order. Ho-hum. An hour and another bottle of wine later five hangry and tipsy foodies got their meals from one especially sassy waitress. In general, the food on the table seemed to be up to its high standards, although I found my coconut soup was tepid and the noodles were way overcooked.\r\n\r\nThe cherry on top was when we went to go pay- I was the last at the table to pay- the waitress now informs me that there was corking fee (which there wasn\'t last time...?) and she just assumed I\'d take it since I brought the wine. Ho-hum.\r\n\r\nOk. Rant over. Maybe avoid this place on a weekday? They seem to be understaffed on weekdays. You should still try Burmese food.  There is a special charm about eating out on a slow evening in Montreal. More often you end up chatting with the owners. This was one of those evenings. Sunday afternoon drinks led to late night dinner. As we stumble into Ruby Burma we were greeted by a pleasant Burmese lady, who also happens to be the owner.\r\n\r\nDespite my friends unintentional efforts to insult the owner, she kept a calm demeanor and explained that my friend could replace chicken with tofu if requested (Good News Vegetarians!)\r\n\r\nThis was my second visit, the last time I can confirm they know how to pack heat in the food. This time I was intrigued by "Dan Pauk" or as the owner explained to me, a "Burmese Biryani". Now the Biryani is a very complicated dish to make, everybody has their unique twist to it. Some people can go simple or some people can complicate the dish with lots of flavour and saturated fat. Here I was pleasantly surprised it wasn\'t the standard "lets bombard it with heat so you cannot taste the flavor" Biryani that Montreal is cursed with. The sweetness came from fried onions (which are caramelised at this point) and a helping of assorted nuts (Bad news Allergetic people!). Also the accompanying cucumber "salad" mixed with the Dan Pauk is an excellent dash of complexity to the experience.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get a chance to talk with the owner for a longer period, ask her about her life, travelling the world with her husband. Sometimes restaurant raconteurs will surprise you!  Delicious Burmese food which is like a confluence of Indian and Thai food. The service is a bit slow and then we realised that everything is cooked from scratch so more like home cooked Burmese cuisine which we are totally OK to wait 20-30 minutes to eat.  I have now been here three times and I can say with conviction that it is one of my favorite places in Montreal. Don't let the outside fool you, the food is fresh, delicious and options for everyone are plentiful. Not only that, the hosts are kind, charming and helpful. \r\n\r\nThe coconut chicken soup with egg noodles is warming and has the perfect ratio of noodles to broth, the flavors and textures bring the whole thing together. \r\n\r\nThe vegetable curry is amazing, could have possibly been spicier but there is nothing I like less then receiving a pile of mush with curry flavor, here every single vegetable was recognizable, cooked perfectly in a thick sauce\r\n\r\nAs for the salads, nothing but good things to say, they are varied, flavorful, and have lots of care put into them! \r\n\r\nI really cannot wait to go back and try the other dishes! Im sure they will be just as fabulous.\r\n\r\nAlso, save space for desert!! The cake is absolutely to die for.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all amazing food and lovely hosts.  What a nice bright new little light on a sometimes dingy, mini-skirt-over-ridden stretch of St Laurent! We moseyed in last night on our way from the Pop HQ up to shows and found just what the reviews below describe - bright, spacious, clean, not fancy but lovingly tended to. Our waiter was young, kind and attentive with a dear smile and - most importantly - we didn't feel like we had to overstress the fact that we were looking for low on the spicy meter (my friend has a serious reason for asking, and all too often the request is ignored.) You could tell he took this question seriously, and we knew we were in good hands.\r\n\r\nBut anyway - the food! The fermented tea leaf salad is such a combination of light and savoury flavours, plus cripsy roast nuts and seasame seeds I plan to pop in and just order this for myself for a quick meal in the future. So filling and delish! We also shared the chickpea fritters, yummy and not greasy which would be their downfall, but nothing to bang gongs over - next time I'll try the Inles Fries instead! We also shared the tamarind pork curry which was just perfect. Soft delicious pork, no bits of fat left lurking beneath the thick sauce, all succulent bites ready to get melty in your mouth. Not too spicy or too fruity, just an amazing flavour with a kick. \r\n\r\nYou can tell this is a family place making every dish with love, bringing incredibly delicate Burmese flavours to Montreal (yay! and finally!) I'll be back.  Love this place! The flavors of this cuisine make me salivate and I actually have to hold myself back from going to Ruby multiple times per week; I don't want the owner to think I can't cook haha :) But really, such an interesting mix of salt\\/spice\\/sour, just amazing. I usually either get the Shan Khaut Sw\xc3\xa8, a noodle dish with cubed chicken, super tasty Asian pickle, peanuts, onions, etc (also comes with a bowl of clear broth lightly seasoned which our lovely waiter told us once should be eaten separately\\/not mixed with the noodles), or sometimes I get the equally great Nanpyar Thoke which is an egg noodle dish with curried chicken, coriander, oniond, garlic and cream of cocounut soup. This last dish really doesn't taste of coconut for those who may fear that. It just makes the dish creamy and all the more slurp worthy! We also pretty much always get the spring rolls as an appetizer. These have potatoes, green peas, carrots, and have a super silky interior overall. The dipping sauce is nice and spicy.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I've ever had here that didn't totally suit my taste was the chickpea tofu fries (appetizer), and if I'm honest, it's because I kinda\\/really hate tofu! (was trying to be healthy lol)\r\n\r\nBesides the food, what makes this place even more worthy are the lovely owner and her staff. She really cares whether you like your food and even asks if everything is OK if she sees you didn't finish your plate!! It's also BYOW, and who doesn't love that. The icing on the cake, though, is the pricing! VERY affordable. One shared appetizer and two mains is around $25 with tax! Many main dishes are $9!\r\n\r\nPlease frequent this place, and keep it in business! That stretch of St-Laurent is suffering right now with crazy rents and empty building after empty building.\r\n\r\nI hope this place stays forever!  The menu is authentic & delicious & satisfying. The ambience is a bit bright & stark.  Well it's been 50 minutes waiting for food. So that's great. Not even the appetizer is out.  Took 20m before we got the menu .\r\n\r\nHowever the tealeaf salad is amazing also the fritters \r\nThe main dishes plate 23 and 30 vegetarian and shrimp curry were okay\r\n\r\nMy suggestion don't come hungry but the food is great  One of the best Asian cuisine in Montreal. This place went beyond my expectation! The dishes tasted good and most of all low prices!\r\nWe got the tea leaf salad and chicken noodles. \r\nThose dished looked fresh and made with all natural ingredient. \r\nThe tealeaf salad was crunch with nuts and the dressing was kinda like Italian dressing but with some additional Burmese flavour. \r\nThe chicken noodles was awesome, it came with some soup, but tasted better without. The different flavour mixed together well and I just wanted more. \r\nI will definitely be a regular at this place. \r\nAlso, the service was good too!  I never had Burmese food before but I like all Asian cousins. I must say this place is one of the special hidden secrets in the city. The food is amazing, according to the owner, they make everything from scratch. It does taste like homemade. The portions are decent. My only observation though, the service is a bit slow but I do not mind waiting 5 extra minutes for a freshly made meal. I am definitely going back.  The tea leaf salad is a must!  It is super refreshing and unlike anything else I've ever had.  The pork with tamarind sauce was very tender and delicious.  The location is convenient and the staff was very nice and accommodating.  I would come here all the time if I lived closer!  Tried the chicken rice noodle dish and it seemed to be fresh and unique. The chicken broth that came with it seemed to be home made as well as I didn't detect any msg. Portions are small and the amount of meat is skimpy, half an hour has passed since my meal and I'm hungry again. Guys might wanna order an appetizer or 2 to go with their meal.\r\n\r\nService wasn't the greatest and was slow in general but the place seemed clean enough. I enjoyed my meal, this place gets an A for effort.  The food was excellent, the coconut milk - curry soup that I had was so flavorful and was one of my favorite dishes that I had while in Montreal. My two friends also had a fantastic meal as well. But I was compelled to write a yelp review because of the earnest kindness of the waiter and the woman who rang us up.\r\n\r\nThese are such friendly, positive people who (I know this sounds weird) actually seem to really care about you and how good your experience is. They asked us multiple times if we needed anything and were extremely hospitable. At the end the woman talked to me about burmese food and wished us a happy new year. Excellent people and you should give them your business based on how awesome they are. The undeniable food is a bonus!  I was passing by the other day,and found out it was closed for good...haven't got the chance to try it !no  Bring your own wine, SAQ (place to buy alcohol in Qu\xc3\xa9bec) just in front. Very decent price, great flavor, spicy meat. I recommend Martin Coday,  Albarino white wine with the food :)  The service is ridiculous. The food is unoriginal. The server\\/chef lady made recommendations based on our 'ethnic palate preferences' and they were still horrible. She served us a yellow, strange fish curry dish and a chicken dish which was a bit better. The appetizers - something called 'bee-a-joo' were strange and lacking in proportion.  The food was not great, the wait ,inordinately long. They brought 1 curry after 1 hour but with no rice. They hurriedly cooked a frozen packet into another curry. Brought out hurriedly made noodles. They took a long time for our appetizers as well. They are short staffed. The wait staff was friendly & courteous & in the end they offered us complementary dessert. It was too little too late. We spent a $100 for food which in quality & service was worth a whole lot less. We could have had quicker, tastier food at a fast food restaurant. Unless they get their organizing act together & get a good chef, I don't see them being in business for long. The restaurant was very hot & there was no A\\/C or fans in place. On the whole a very uncomfortable, not worth it dining experience.  I eat at Ruby Burma about once a week, I love it. Super reasonable prices considering the quality if the food, great friendly service. One of my favorite spots in Montreal.  Ruby Burma is an amazing little gem located on buzzing St-Laurent Street. Upon entering and sitting down, my husband and I noticed the calm and serene atmosphere of the Burmese restaurant. Big windows allow for a great view of the street, its pedestrians, its nearby businesses and, in spring and summer, a nice breeze.\r\n\r\nAlthough most meals at Ruby Burma contain meat, there are de facto some vegetarian curries on the menu, and it is also possible to request a vegetarian version of other dishes.\r\n\r\nIt was our first time eating Burmese food and we were blown away! We had a Mixed Vegetables Curry and a Shan Noodle Dish, both very tasty, well spiced and simply delicious. I had the opportunity to try with the noodles pickled Chinese vegetables, something I had never had before, and I loved it. The richness and the freshness of the food were topped by an incredible service provided by the owner herself. \r\n\r\nSince Burma (Myanmar) shares borders with India, China and Thailand, it comes as no surprise, in retrospect, that their cuisine displays spices and ingredients from each of those neighboring countries, prepared in a unique (Burmese) way.\r\n\r\nSince my recent visit at Ruby Burma, I'm simply sold on Burmese cuisine and will definitely go back to sample more dishes in the near future!\r\n\r\nP.S. Try their Burmese tea, akin to an Oolong tea. It's pretty good!  I really enjoyed this restaurant for a whole slew of reasons! 1. I love south east asian cuisine and this place hits the spot for mixing all those authentic flavours that you find in that region... honestly, that tea leaf salad was as great as they say and had so much flavor!! 2. Our server was so so friendly. She was a lovely Burmese women and asked us constantly for our feedback and even cooked us two types of naan to hear our opinions. 3. Its is a small business - we gotta support it! There are only three people working at the resto right now and you can tell they've really invested a lot into it and are proud of their country and cuisine. \r\n\r\nWe were a large table (8) and so service was a bit slow because of this coupled with their very tiny staff, but honestly it was a very pleasant experience anyway :) . We ordered a whole variety of items - I had the chicken curry which came with potatoes in the curry and naan and it was great. Everyone else was satisfied with their dishes as well - veggie curries, pork curry tamarind, potatoe curry, and more! I will definitely come back to try their signature fish soup as well in the very near future! Eat here.  Ne vous arr\xc3\xaatez surtout pas au stle du restaurant, qui fait plus cha\xc3\xaene\\/fast-food que petit restaurant typique, ce qu'il est !\r\n\r\nDes plats simples, bons et vraiment originaux. Les petits beignets en entr\xc3\xa9e sont vraiment excellents (le 1), puis salade au th\xc3\xa9 pour moi (top !) et p\xc3\xa2tes aux oeufs pour mon chum (vraiment un go\xc3\xbbt original). Tout \xc3\xa7a pour un excellent rapport qualit\xc3\xa9\\/quantit\xc3\xa9\\/prix.\r\n\r\nBref, il y a des tr\xc3\xa8s fortes chances que nous y revenions !  Very tasty and interesting. We had the fermented-tea-leaf noodle salad and catfish chowder. She told us, when she served it, that they use Tilapia instead of Catfish (Umm, shouldnt you put that on the menu?) since Quebecois don't like the taste of catfish. But it was still excellent. They do not serve alcohol, so BYOB. Service is a bit slow, but still a great place to eat and really nice break between the heavy French meals on the rest of our trip.  The food here is fresh, delicate, and full of flavor. It is all prepared fresh in-house with no MSG or other preservatives. You can tell. \r\n\r\nThe tea leaf salad was delicious and bright. The fried noodles with chinese sausage and tofu was a bit like a pad thai, but less oily and more complex. Very delicious.\r\n\r\nService was excellent and friendly. Highly recommend this place for a delicious and fresh meal.  Really liked ruby Burma - would definitely go back.  The decor, location, and service is excellent. This was the first time I had tea leaf salad so I didn't know what to expect and maybe it was because I asked for it to be prepared vegetarian, but the dressing was way to overpowering. The peanuts and other bits were good but it was very salty and I could barely taste the tea leaves or anything else for that matter.  When I mentioned it at the end, the server said that it was a possibility, which confused me because it is their job to make sure the dishes they present are good. I do want to come back to try the Inlay fries though.  I live close by and wanted to try something a little different.   The food was fragrant and not too heavy.  I didnt think I ordered that much but was difinately full when I walked out of there.  The service was fantastic.  Byob is a was a great touch, and there is an SAQ up the block. I look forward to going back.  I can't remember what we had, but it was all very good.   Reasonable prices.  Maybe ten tables.  Small staff -- seemed like just the cook (who could be seen from most tables) and the hostess\\/waitress\\/owner. There could be a long wait if it's full.  Bring some good company.   I liked the fact that the portions were the right size (rather than being way-too-large as they are at many places).  I was here for the fame of the tea leaf salad. I came in the restaurant on Sunday evening and immediately made an order of the salad and seated myself at the table close to the counter as the owner said I could sit where I prefer. It was a very warm evening and the big window was opened to allow air circulation and direct connection with the street. This actually attracts some flies and spider wondering around my table and kept me accompany throughout the whole dinner experience. \r\n\r\nFifteen mins later the owner brought my tea leaf salad along with a fork and knife without water. The salad was already mixed, unlike some previous pictures here on Yelp showed serving as unmixed items (I guess they don't do it anymore). The seeds and peanuts made the salad crunchy and tasty but the vegetable part is just lettuce and tomato lacking varieties and flavours. There was some chopped tea leaves in between that tastes bitter (yep, it is supposed to be bitter. No surprise on that). 7 mins into eating, a glass of water finally came from a smiling waitress. She looks friendly.\r\n\r\nThe salad cost 11.50 dollar before tax, 13.23 after the 15% Quebec tax, and 15.21 after the default 15% tips. The credit card machine prompted me to give 15%, 20%, or 25% tips. Really?\r\n\r\nThe restaurant feels like a fast meal place in general. The pricy salad and all, I am not gonna recommend it.  This place is AMAZING, I've done tons of traveling and love ethnic food. This place is legit! Seriously every dish has been amazing. I turned my whole office onto this place and we are all hooked! And they're SO NICE! Please support them! The fermented tea leaf salad as odd as it sounds is off the charts.  I went there with my girlfriend not knowing what to expect from Burmese food and we were amazed by how good it was. This definitely something to try and I'll go back there again !  My last meal of 2013 summed up an amazing year: trying new things and great food.\r\n\r\nNever tried Burmese cuisine before, but if this is what it tastes like over there, my next trip is catching the next flight there. \r\n\r\nWe ordered 3 things (see pictures if you don't mind salivating): \r\nLatphet Thoke (tea leaf salad)\r\nByah Kyaw (chickpea fritters)\r\nOhn noh kauksweh (coconut milk soup noodles)\r\n\r\nEverything was amazing. The fritters were some of the best fried food I've put in my mouth (and I've eaten a lot of fried stuff). Dipped in the cilantro tamarind sauce will make an addict out of you. The tea leaf salad had tons of ingredients, great texture and great balance. The noodles were very, very hearty, perfect for a -25 degree NYE in Montreal. Sprinkle some pepper flakes, lime and raw onion (provided) to give it that great kick. \r\n\r\nEvery staff member (except one) is from Myanmar, so you can bet your savings on the authenticity.\r\n\r\nCheck out the owner's bio on the Yelp page, she's a very interesting person! Got to chat to her about the situation in Burma aka Myanmar and ask her travel advice! One of my new favourite cuisines (although I do say that a lot...)  If you like good burmese food, please don't come here. I went to Ruby Burma with great expectations based on the Yelp reviews but was sorely disappointed. We tried the tea leaf salad (which was mostly lettuce and a bit soggy), the kow soy (bland, without the crispy noodles and pickles), and another salad (which was also soggy). Nothing was authentic or fresh for that matter unfortunately. I expected much better.  The cook who inspired all of these rave Yelp reviews must have been off the evening my friend and I went because the food here was so bland and underwhelming. We had such high hopes for Montreal's first Burmese restaurant, but left disappointed. We will not return and will not recommend this restaurant to our friends. I gave two stars to this establishment for the fact that the owner was courteous with us and prompt in placing our order.  My wife and I just ate here last night and loved it.  Everything here is made fresh and with care--true authentic Burmese home cooking.  I enjoyed it so much I returned today and ordered their fish curry with salmon.  Again, I truly enjoyed it.  I will definitely be back often.  Just stopped by to check out this place following some excellent friend recommendation.  While we did not really want to eat much we did sample their soup (chicken lemongrass) and their fish dish which was really impressive.  This is a new discovery and I look forward to trying more dishes, this seems like a perfect place for a multiple diner experience.  I am planning a redo with lots of friends so we can sample each dish.  They are a BYOB which is nice (what with for brothers and the SQ meters away.  Will update when I have tried more but so far so very good.  Awesome new restaurant to the Saint Laurent scene!!\r\nIf you have never tried Burmese food before run don't walk to it now!!\r\nThe owner Pri will guide you through the food and culture that Burma (now known as Myanmar). I had the Mohinga which is soup made from fish, garlic, onions and lemongrass. It is served with thin rice noodles and other condiments. The taste is so refreshing and it is fishy. I also had the tea leaf salad which is made out of fermented tea leaves. But trust me that this will be one of the best and unique thing you will ever eat in your life (Anthony Bourdain just had some on his trip to Myanmar and loved it). This salad is a perfect appetizer to start your meal. I wish NY\\/NJ had a Burmese restaurant that was half as good as Ruby Burma. Please support this place and Montreal will have another star in their restaurant world for many years to come!!  This place is supposedly very authentic Burmese cuisine, but I don't think I could tell the difference. The staff was very nice and accomodating. We stopped in on a weekday evening, and the place was quiet with plenty of open tables.\r\n\r\nI had the tamarind curry, which was good but not great. The curry was more watery than I would have expected and I really couldn't find any tamarind flavor in it.\r\n\r\nWe had a couple of the appetizers, and they were nice.  The service was fast and friendly and the food was phenomenal!  I ordered the crunchy roll and the west view roll and they were so good!  10\\/10 would eat again  My husband and I decided to visit Royal Myanmar based on earlier reviews. We are so glad we did. I had really fresh sushi and my husband chose the chicken fried rice, which was very tasty. Both of us enjoyed the miso soup which was the best I've had. We plan to return to try other menu items. So many!!  This little restaurant has been on my must do list for a while now and after 1 visit, I'm looking forward to more! Burmese cuisine was different than what I pictured in advance and I have to say our minor sampling intrigued me to know and explore their menu more. The prices here are so reasonable that you can sample many dishes very reasonably. \r\n\r\nThere are several amazing sounding soups and salads. The ginger salads were included with our meals & they were possibly the most flavorful I've ever had. Good start. We shared the seafood sushi sampler - very basic but at $6.99 for 16 pieces, you can't go wrong. I order the pickled mango pork and my husband got the chicken curry with cumin. We intentionally picked more traditional Burmese dishes and we're really glad we did. Both were dishes of roasted meats packed with incredible flavor with a side of rice. Sort of felt like delicious comfort food. Very unexpected in a very good way. \r\n\r\nService was exceptional and the space is very basic and casual. The food is clearly the star and its apparent they do a brisk take-out business here, too.  We have been sad ever since the closing of Burma Tokyo in Oakland. Now that we've finally made it out here, it's pretty clear that this will be the replacement. It's totally a local hidden gem, and if you are just passing by it may just seem like another sushi bar. I can't say anything about their sushi, but the rest of the menu has plenty of Southeast Asian dishes to go around. Lots of different appetizers and salads, noodle soups and fried noodle, fried rice and meat\\/vegetable dishes. A good chunk is Thai-esque or close to Thai, while many others are more Burmese and can't be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh as far as I'm aware. The stir fried flat rice noodle (N3 on their menu) may remind you of a pad see ew, but it tastes quite difference and has lots of flavors in its own way (for one thing, more variety of ingredients). We also enjoyed the rice vermicelli and meatball soup (SP4, kway owe)--the noodles were very thin and fine, the meatballs (more like chunks) went well with the quail egg, and the richness of the broth was on the lighter side, which put the whole thing together. Overall, along with nice facilities and friendly service, this is definitely the place to go for Burmese food.  I have stopped by here twice now for lunch, most recently with my father this a couple of Tuesday's ago.  We arrived at around 11:30 to find an empty restaurant.  As soon as we walked in our server hurried out from the back and gave us our choice of seats.  After taking our drink order she also turned on some calming music which I assume was Burmese.  The inside of Royal Myanmar isn't too much to look at.  The walls look like they can use a paint job but there are some paintings hanging on them.\r\n\r\nFor my lunch entree on this day I decided to go with the spicy basil chicken, spice level 9.  My dish consisted of stir fried chicken with basil, onion, bell pepper, scallion, cilantro with house special sauce and a side of rice.  Both my meat and my vegetables were cooked nicely in this dish.  What I really enjoyed the most about my dish was the sauce which had both some heat and some really complex flavors.  It made eating the dish incredibly enjoyable.  Service here was also really good as our server was constantly back to our table checking whether we need anything.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything that I have tried here has been good on both of my visits and the service has been good as well.  Went there after seeing high ratings. Location is not easily accessible  unless you live in the area. Was disappointed unfortunately. Wait time was long despite only one other family seated , food was very ordinary and bland. Tofu was dripping in oil. We tried the chicken on stick and chicken coconut curry. It felt re heated and Probably Not fresh. Only liked their samosas and the sauce. Service while slow was very nice. Only one person was serving food to the whole place. It was Friday night but about 1\\/3 capacity full. \r\n\r\nFor someone who is not familiar with authentic Burmese\\/Indian style food, it may work. Because of the location, quality of food and wait times, will not be going there again. \r\n\r\nYou can't say now that no one warned you !  Delicious unique food. Rather sparse and plain atmosphere. Yes a hole in the wall. BYOB. Bar around the corner that does take out six packs and liquor store a half mile away. Had dishes I've never had before.  \r\n\r\nSeems out of place in West View. They should move it to Lawrenceville.  Great food! Been here 3 or 4 times now. Pad Thai is my favorite dish here so far. Also tried spicy basil fried rice amongst a few other things. Looking forward to exploring the menu more. Everything has really been great. Wish I lived closer so I could come more often!  This is probably my fav food place in Pittsburgh. The food was so delicious and scrumptious. I would definitely stop by again  We were pleasantly surprised! We didn't expect much out of a sushi place in west view but a 5 star review fits well. From the ginger salad, to the spicy basil chicken, everything was good... But the sushi, wow! The west view roll, Myanmar roll, shrimp tempura roll were all very good, better than ones I get downtown. The only way I know this place existed was by word of mouth, so I hope more people find out and keep a great restaurant in business.  The food here reminds me a lot of Thai food. We asked the server, who was telling us her story of being a refugee, which dishes were traditional Burmese dishes. She grabbed the owner for us, who is very warm and amiable. She recommended several dishes, after which I got the Lemongrass beef stew that comes with a side of coconut rice. It was very tasty. My partner got the thick rice noodle dish with chicken, and it was also good. I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was the biggest I have ever seen!  Which I was very happy about because usually they are mostly ice. Overall, very satisfying.  The service was good, food was good.  So I will start with what they need to work on. The lights. We are eating dinner, not breakfast, where we need the lights so bright we can read the newspaper. Turn them way down and you are there, as the food is marvelous!!!  We took a couple of bottles of wine. I order the dragon and rainbow rolls. Excellent!! I asked for a garlic fish sauce for dipping and no problem!  My hubby's pad thia was decadent!!  Our friends pork with peanut sauce was as well. I will go back even if they don't turn the lights down, but this is such a simple way to make your restaurant special. Please do it!!  Holy crap - what? Is the most fun sushi in Pittsburgh being served in a little hole in the wall in West View? it kind of seems like it is .... the way DiPietro\'s belongs as the undeniable anchor of the Centre-Perry, frankly, Royal Myanmar belongs there on merit alone. Their sushi offerings are HUGE, and it\'s clear the ingredients are fresh and of high quality. Where this joint really shines is in the specialty rolls. At like 8-10 bucks, these things are seriously like 30-50% bigger than your average GOOD roll from your typical joints around town. Not to take anything from them - I do love, like, Umi, and Andy\'s in Wholey\'s - but for like $9 to get a specialty roll unlike anything else I\'ve ever had (there are plenty of fun, creative ingredients and combinations they\'ve come up with here) is good enough to make a guy like me happy. The fact that it is enough maki to fill like a full-sized dinner plate really just makes it a home run.  \r\n\r\nAnd that\'s before talking about the Burmese food. I only had one dish, some savory pork thing. It was awesome. This was a delivery order - I just left a note saying something to the effect of "please make this as spicy as possible." Normally, I leave a note like that and expect, really, literally nothing in response. Even when I leave a note like that, if they ignore my note but the food is good, I\'m a happy camper. But the awesome ladies at Royal Myanmar actually just went ahead and killed it on this. The woman who met met at the counter explained that they saw my request for extra spiciness and stood about for a moment thinking about how to make the dish spicy where they did not normally offer it as spicy (I failed to think of this). She assured me they\'d come up with a great plan -- included in the mix were some hot green chiles that they\'d decided would add heat to the dish without screwing up the flavor balance. This was contrary to the red fried chiles we\'re all used to seeing in spicy-designed dishes and\\/or the red chili paste that restaurants (and I) just slather on to make dishes spicy. That was just like incredibly thoughtful and cool. And you know what? My pork dish was awesome; it had some added spice from the green chiles, but even if it hadn\'t had that, it would still have been great because the quality of the meat was really good and the vegetables were perfectly cooked.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the level of attention to their work they have at this place... The sushi is insane, the stir fried cuisine is just perfect.... frankly, I can\'t wait to eat at Royal Myanmar again. I want to eat the rest of this place\'s menu. It\'s just awesome. I hope West View steps up and proves it deserves it.  The food is very delicious. More importantly, food is naturally made without artificial ingredients. \r\nFor drink, do try Royal mayammar tea and mango milk shake.  Hi.. I am the waitress here at Royal Myanmar! And I believe that our food here is the best Asian food in Pittsburgh. If you like authentic Asian food this is the place for you! We have Thai, Burmese, some Chinese, and Japanese (sushi). Everything here is fresh, you get big portions for your money, and the chef's here put their heart and soul in to what they love to do.. which is cook for you. It's about time we've got something new in West View.. come and check us out you won't be disappointed!!  Trust me - this is The Best Sushi in the North Pittsburgh area.  We used to go weekly to Cranberry's Taipei (Jimmy Wan's).  And we do enjoy the atmosphere of the Slippery Mermaid in Sewickley.  However, NOTHING compares to the fresh and thoughtful sushi at Royal Myanmar.  We have ordered platters for parties, dined in, and we take out weekly.  The portions are generous for the price - Taipei in Cranberry is serving fractions of the amount of food, and charging well over Royal Myanmar's prices.  This place is SO worth the visit!  We stumbled on this place after Slippery Mermaid said they were done seating people at 8:30pm on a Friday evening. So glad they did because the sushi here was some of the best I've ever eaten. We ordered a sushi platter and got a delicious sample of sushis. 38 pieces for only 30.00. The rainbow roll was so fresh and made to perfection. The staff was super friendly and stayed to talk to us after our meal. This hidden gem will be a place I will most certainly be frequenting. Only had sushi but their menu is extensive and impressive as well. Add this to your go to place!  Nothing high end to make you go out of your way but half the price of sesame inn and same quality. Our local sushi go to!  I've never ventured into the Westview before but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out Burmese cuisine! I went on a Friday night around 7 with my family. Upon entering, we were a little unsure based on the appearance. This place is small and lacks decor and proper lighting for the dinner crowd. We were told to pick our town table and as we headed to a spot in the corner, a waitress passed us carrying a sushi boat. The moment we saw that boat, we knew all the Yelp reviews were accurate! Wow- beautiful presentation and variety! \r\n\r\nWe started with fresh spring rolls, squash fritters, blue crab roll and philly roll. They don't offer gluten free soy sauce but the sauces with the fritters and spring rolls are delicious. The rolls were fresh and exactly as described in the menu. The spring rolls were also freshly wrapped and not pre-made chilling in a fridge. I didn't try the fritters but my mom loved them, especially the sauce. We also ordered a Thai iced tea and an avocado milkshake. I thought my mother was going to choke on the milkshake she drank it so quickly. Her eyes were the size of dinner plates, she was so excited about how good it was. My Thai iced tea was refreshing! I used to make them when I worked at a Vietnamese restaurant & was very pleased with their version. \r\n\r\nOur entrees were spicy noodle with steamed tofu and veggies, singapore noodles with shrimp ,beef with lentils and miso soup. I was disappointed with the spice level of my spicy noodle dish, especially since I asked for an 8. I had to order a side of hot sauce. Fortunately, they gave me chili pepper paste and it was the perfect addition! The Singapore noodles were amazing. The best I've ever had. I couldn't believe how much flavor pulled through the noodles on their own. I tried the lentil sauce and it had in Indian flavor twist. A bit of spice so the side of rice smoothed out the punch. The miso soup needed salt but other than that- it was just how I like miso! Loaded with seaweed and tofu!\r\n\r\nFor dessert, we shared sticky rice with fresh sliced mango. Alone, the rice isn't that sweet but enter the mango to spruce up the dish! Fantastic combination! \r\n\r\nThe prices are incredibly reasonable. Portion sizes are huge, everyone in my family had a to-go box. Service was very friendly and wait time wasn't too bad, considering how quickly the restaurant filled while we were there. I am pumped to go back and try more of their menu, especially a sushi boat!!  Had the royal   Myanmar appetizer, house salad, and sashimi combo. The appetizer was delicious, and the royal Myanmar tofu was super tasty. The salad with ginger dressing came free with checking in through yelp. the sashimi with combo was not that great since it had a weird taste to it; it seemed like it came out of the fridge with a mildew taste. \r\n\r\nI would like to come back for the tofu but the fish really disappointed me.  I could eat here every day.  The sushi is phenomenal (try the West View roll!), and the rest of the menu is very authentic and tasty.  Excellent sushi, my husband got the pork curry it was also excellent! Highly recommended!  I love this place.  Went for my daughter's 18th birthday - five of us.  Delicious food, wonderful people....this is our new home!  Day after Christmas such a crazy holiday my husband and I had a chance to slip out and try this little place in Westview. Upon entering you think no way this food will be worth five stars. But the moment we met our hostess we knew we were in good hands. So do not be turned off by the lack of Decour and the very small size of the restaurant.\r\nThe menu has a nice Thai and Indian influence. From Currys to spice and slightly sweet drinks we enjoyed every bite. My husband ordered the spicy basil pork and I had the coconut chicken curry. We shared a Thai iced tea definitely order the Thai tea. \r\nI especially enjoyed talking with and having her her explain the influence the regions took upon the menu. Can't wait to go back and try other items.  Small restaurant. But, Great food. I ordered fish curry. They start cooking when I ordered. Very fresh taste. Tea leave salad was amazing. Yes, TEA LEAVE SALAD. Real TEA leave that you can eat.  I knew nothing about Burmese cuisine so I was pretty excited to hear that there was a Burmese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Thanks Kristina P. for putting it on my radar!\r\n\r\nAnyway, the restaurant is not fancy and it's pretty much like any other Asian restaurant: white walls with functional, rather than decorative, tables and chairs, little to no decor. The menu looked to be a mix of Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, and Thai. There were no distinctions so we had to ask the owner which dishes were Burmese and she was incredibly helpful. We ordered the Royal Myanmar Combination Sampler to start, I got the Ohn-no Kauk Swe (Chicken noodle soup with coconut milk) and the hubby got the Coconut Chicken Curry. My favorite part of the sampler was the samosas. They were filled with a potato and onion filling which carried a slight curry flavor. They had what seemed to be a spring roll wrapper as the outer shell so it was crunchy on the outside and soft and comforting on the inside. Our entrees were very comforting and rich, making them great items to order on a cold fall or winter day. Flavors were mild too, as in not at all spicy. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would come back to give other Burmese menu items a try!  With all the good reviews, I had to try this place.  I started out with the spring rolls.  They gave me six of them. They were fresh and very good dipped in a sweet peanut sauce. The salads were nice and cold and crisp with a ginger dressing.  I had the spicy basil beef with peppers, mushrooms and cilantro in a great sauce served with brown rice.  We also had a shrimp dish that was like shrimp fried rice but with noodles.  It was great too!\r\nGood size portions, everything fresh and tasty!  Oh....and the Thai iced tea!  OMG it reminded me of a White Russian!  No wonder I sucked it down!  It was fantastic!  If you like Burmese food, a little Thai, Indian and Chinese dishes, you will love this place.  The place is small, not fancy but very reasonable prices. I will definitely be back!  My wife and I have eaten here six or seven times, and we are "old friends" to the owner, who is extremely friendly. She will happily explain each dish and how it is prepared. My wife tends to get P3 (we don\'t remember the name), which is delicious every time. I always get the sushi, which is just as good as the other reviews say it is. I like the simple Philly roll with smoked salmon, but have also tried the West View roll and several others. The complimentary salad is VERY good, with exceptional ginger dressing. \r\n\r\nThere is usually quiet Burmese background music, which sets a nice mood for dinner. \r\n\r\nLike many family-owned Asian restaurants, the family\'s children are often in attendance. They are invariably quiet and well-behaved, and we really enjoy their presence. One boy is often present doing his school work (education is very important in Myanmar\\/Burma).  Great food! We had the fried rice and the house special\r\nNoodle soup - both very good with a unique and authentic flavor that we've not had other places. We will be back here soon!  Best sushi for the price!  Friendly staff.  Walls could use a fresh coat of paint but the overall dining experience was pleasant and I will be going back.  I dont feel the food is anything different from Thai (same feeling as Nepal food to Indian food). The decoration was also disappointing.  I am so pleased to give the Royal Myanmar my \r\n5-star review.  Don't let the modest decor fool you!  The cuisine at this little restaurant is packed with delightful flavors. We began with appetizers, including the Fresh & Crispy Spring Rolls and the Sampler Platter, which included Chicken Satay, Crispy Tofu and Samosa, all of which were fresh and delicious and were accompanied by flavorful sauces.  We were all very pleased with each meal; once again, the flavors were just wonderful. We enjoyed them all:  Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Lemongrass Beef w\\/Coconut Rice and Kyarzan Kyaw.  I thoroughly recommend this diamond-in-the-rough as a must-try.  I did some take out and was very happy with my order. So glad to have found this new spot ! I had a few sushi rolls and they were delicious and well priced. I'll be returning for sure.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. You can tell that the cooks go above and beyond making the food, it's maybe the most flavorful Asian food I've ever had. The presentation is simple and clean, and so is the interior of the restaurant - nothing to distract you from the food.\r\n\r\nWhen I first went I ordered samosas to start and the beef and pumpkin curry. Definitely the best samosas I've ever had, ultra crispy and bursting with flavor. The beef was tender and seasoned to perfection. Since then I've ordered a couple other things off the menu and it's all excellent. I haven't tried it but I've heard their sushi is good too!\r\n\r\nThe service is fast and friendly and the prices are incredibly reasonable for such well made food. If you haven't tried this restaurant I highly recommend you do so!  \xe6\x99\xae\xe9\x80\x9a\xe7\x9a\x84\xe9\x97\xa8\xe9\x9d\xa2\xe5\x92\x8c\xe5\x86\x85\xe5\x9c\xa8\xe8\xa3\x85\xe4\xbf\xae\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xbd\x86\xe6\x98\xaf\xe8\x8f\x9c\xe5\x93\x81\xe5\xb9\xb2\xe5\x87\x80\xe3\x80\x81\xe6\x96\xb0\xe9\xb2\x9c\xe3\x80\x81\xe5\x91\xb3\xe9\x81\x93\xe5\xa5\xbd\xe3\x80\x82\xe6\x9c\x8d\xe5\x8a\xa1\xe5\x91\x98\xe5\xa5\xb6\xe5\xa5\xb6\xe8\x87\xb3\xe5\xb0\x91\xe4\xbc\x9a\xe4\xb8\x89\xe7\xa7\x8d\xe8\xaf\xad\xe8\xa8\x80\xef\xbc\x8c\xe5\xa4\xaa\xe5\xbc\xba\xe4\xba\x86\xef\xbc\x81\r\n\xe6\x88\x91\xe4\xbb\xac\xe4\xb8\x89\xe4\xb8\xaa\xe4\xba\xba\xe7\x82\xb9\xe4\xba\x86\xe4\xb8\x80\xe4\xb8\xaa\xe5\xa4\xb4\xe8\x8f\x9c\xe6\x8b\xbc\xe7\x9b\x98Royal Myanmar Combination Sampler\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xb8\x80\xe4\xb8\xaa\xe5\xaf\xbf\xe5\x8f\xb8\xe6\x8b\xbc\xe7\x9b\x98 Royal Myanmar Platter\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xb8\x80\xe6\x9d\xaf\xe7\x89\x9b\xe6\xb2\xb9\xe6\x9e\x9c\xe5\xa5\xb6\xe6\x98\x94\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xb8\x80\xe4\xbb\xbd\xe7\x94\x9c\xe5\x93\x81\xef\xbc\x8c\xe5\x85\xa8\xe9\x83\xa8\xe5\x90\x83\xe5\x85\x89\xef\xbc\x81\r\n\xe5\xba\x97\xe4\xb8\xbb\xe8\xb5\xa0\xe9\x80\x81\xe4\xba\x86\xe5\xa7\x9c\xe6\xb1\x81\xe6\xb2\x99\xe6\x8b\x89\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xb8\x8d\xe7\x88\xb1\xe5\x90\x83\xe6\xb2\x99\xe6\x8b\x89\xe7\x9a\x84\xe5\x84\xbf\xe5\xad\x90\xe9\x83\xbd\xe6\x8a\xa2\xe7\x9d\x80\xe5\x90\x83\xe3\x80\x82\r\n\xe7\x94\x9c\xe5\x93\x81\xe7\xb1\xbb\xe7\xac\xac\xe4\xb8\x80\xe4\xb8\xaa\xe7\x9a\x84Golden Shwe Ji\xe6\x98\xaf\xe7\x83\xad\xe7\x9a\x84\xef\xbc\x8c\xe6\x9c\x89\xe7\x82\xb9\xe5\x83\x8f\xe5\x8f\x91\xe7\xb3\x95\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xbd\x86\xe6\x98\xaf\xe5\x8f\xa3\xe6\x84\x9f\xe6\x9b\xb4\xe5\xa5\xbd\xef\xbc\x8c\xe7\x94\x9c\xe8\x80\x8c\xe4\xb8\x8d\xe8\x85\xbb\xef\xbc\x8c\xe7\x89\xb9\xe5\x88\xab\xe6\x8e\xa8\xe8\x8d\x90\xef\xbc\x81\r\n\xe4\xb8\x80\xe5\xae\x9a\xe5\xbe\x97\xe5\x86\x8d\xe5\x8e\xbb\xef\xbc\x81  Sushi was fantastic! Didn't expect to like it so much. And the prices are great too! I'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu.  Having been to Royal Myanmar twice now, I am very conflicted in my review.   Both times the portion times were generous.  The price points are reasonable and the staff is warm and inviting.  Finding Burmese cuisine in the North Hills of Pgh is also very exciting!  I will be back to try them again. Probably for dinner. \r\n\r\nThe first time that I dined the food was amazing. I went to dinner with friends. Spice levels were on point. I was amazed. I shared entrees with my table so I was able to try several dishes. Which were all amazing. My favorites were the Pad Thai which was served with noodles with crunchy fresh peanuts, carrots, and sprouts in a chili paste.  So good. We had it served with chicken. \r\n\r\nOur meal began with sushi and samosa. Honestly, I didn't real dig into the sushi.  My friend was in the mood for it. I just wasn't in a sushi kind of mood and went for the samosa. It was delicious. Filled with warm, perfectly chopped potato, peas, and veggies. Wrapped in a tasty, crispy shell. Spiced perfectly. Each bite better than the previous. \r\n\r\nThe mango sticky rice also stood out for being A-MAZ-ING.  I was hesitant to order it but my friend insisted. So glad she knew what she was doing. It's now a favorite item. We also ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Coconut Curry Chicken.  I loved the it. It was served with big plump clean tasting - as in it tasted like higher quality- pieces of shrimp. The seasoning was perfection and the Rice was filled with fresh basil, green beans, carrot, and just - perfect. \r\n\r\nThe coconut curry & spicy basic chicken were also delicious from the small bites I had. I wish I had given them more attention but I was too full to really get to know them well. I hope to return another day to become better acquainted. \r\n\r\nI left dinner happy, full, highly impressed, and looking forward to my next return. The owners were a delight. I loved the family dynamic of the management and ownership of the restaurant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to another exceptional meal, I invited my deal friend to lunch at Royal Myanmar. We each ordered our own lunch. (Mainly since she is a red meat eater and I'm not.) \r\n\r\nWe started with the Dragon Roll. Which was HUGE and a delight.  Since it was lunch, we didn't even finish it before lunch arrived. We each ordered an entree. I ordered the Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw.  It was not what I expected having previously had their Pad Thai. The Pad Thai is really good. The Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw was singular in spice when hitting my tongue, lacked heat, and not what I expected. Which was extremely disappointing for THIS dish and THIS restaurant. It seemed to lack spice in comparison to my last visit. I'm hoping it was just an off day and that the next time I visit the spicing and notes of flavor are back up to par. Since I've really only had that item once before at a different establishment, I'm not an expert in this ethnic delicacy but it's my understand that it typically has a kick to it that was missing. Despite this dish not being a favorite, I plan to return again soon. This is a restaurant that is worth taking a trip to West View to visit.  I went in and got some sushi to go.  They were extremely nice and helped me through the menu.  The presentation was great and was served on one platter to take home.  The food was really good and I would definitely come back here again.  Small family restaurant but big in portion. My gf and I couldn't finish the 2 entries that we order. Avocado milk shake was delicious and again, have to take the extra in a to-go cup. We will b back again to try out other dishes.  The Royal Myanmar is a wonderful surprise. I am new to Burmese cuisine, but I won't be for long. I ordered 3 vegetarian dishes, the spring rolls and the mango with sticky rice. Everything was delicious. The dining room is small but clean and comfortable. I liked the music, and loved the attentive service.  Great place to try new type of food, especially in Pittsburgh where diverse food selection seems to be quite limited. This was the first time I tried Burmese food and I've gotta say it was good and interesting. This restaurant seems quite popular, too. When we were there for dinner around 8pm, 6 of 9 tables in there were occupied.\r\n\r\nWe opted for tea leaf salad, ka poew chicken (essentially kang pao chicken..but we had no idea it was kang pao chicken..so we ordered)  and pickled mango curry. My husband also tried Burmese tea which was quite strong and not too sweet either (he couldn't go to sleep that night..that's how strong the tea was!). Overall, food portion was large and prices were reasonable. The food itself tasted good..though compared to Thai food that I'm used to..I'd say burmese curry tasted stronger but at the same time...food is generally blender than Thai ones, too.\r\n\r\nNice service though and I was glad I tried it. Burmese food is definitely rare to find..even in my current hometown Seattle...so I was personally happy to get to try something new during my trip in Pittsburgh this time around!  I have had lunch here around a dozen times. Food is amazing. Tried something different every time.  You can't go wrong. Have not tried the sushi yet. Atmosphere is a little sparse but service and meals are out of this world. If you are looking to try Burmese cuisine give Royal Myanmar a try.  Wow! Yay for yelp, bc I certainly would've never found this on my own. Very impressed. Sushi was outstanding. Pad Thai was very good. Spicy chicken curry was like nothing I've ever had, which is always exciting to me (if it's good, haha). Reasonable prices. Really looking forward to going back sometime, even though I don't live very close.  I love this place!  It is truly a hidden gem in West View.  It is definitely not a fancy place inside, but they more than make up for it with their food.  If you eat in, they have the cutest little ceramic fish that you rest your chopsticks on.  I'm not quite sure why I love them so much, but I do!  Take out is also a great option, but make sure you give yourself a little extra time, as they can get very busy on the weekends.\r\n\r\nI go mainly for their sushi, which is delicious!  Our typical order is spicy tuna roll, crunchy shrimp roll and blue crab roll.  Everything is always fresh and tasty.  They have many options from the simple roll to the more complex rolls.  The samosa appetizer is a fried dumpling like creation with a spicy, potato and onion mixture served with a sweet chili sauce on the side.  The prices are more than reasonable for the product you get.  Usually 3 rolls between my boyfriend and I and were are done! (And I promise we live to eat!)\r\n\r\nThe service is always polite and friendly.  It is obviously a local, family owned establishment which I always prefer over the big, chain brands.  If you haven't checked out Royal Myanmar yet, then definitely make plans to do so soon!  Really impressed with the food at Royal Myanmar\r\n Every dish I've tried has had an amazing depth of flavor - not your run of the mill stir-fry here! I particularly liked the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. The sushi menu is varied as well. Give it a try!  Wow! What a hidden gem! I became very fond of Burmese food while living in Washington DC and was very excited to find this restaurant here in Pittsburgh. Although it wasn't on the menu, the chef prepared a delicious Nan Gyi Thoke for me - highly recommended!  Amazing food and service! We drove 30 mins to eat here and it was worth it. Fried tofu (made with chickpeas) were delicious and so were our entrees. We will definitely be coming back!  Back again!\r\nHad the Spicy Basil Chicken and the Spicy Salmon Roll.\r\nAnd of course the Chicken Satay again ... With the awesome peanut sauce\xe2\x80\x8b!\r\nFor Dessert, Burmese Cake (Golden She Ji)\r\nGet this \xc3\xa0 la Mode it is great with a little ice cream!\r\nEvery time I come here it makes me want to return to Myanmar to have good food and see my great friends there!  Do not let the decor fool you. This place is awesome. We've tried a little of everything the few times we've been in- sushi, salads, noodle dishes, soups- everything has been delicious. You will not be disappointed.  After spending an artful morning in Millvale, we looked on our nifty Yelp for somewhere unique to eat for a late lunch.  Royal Myanmar popped up as a ten to fifteen minute drive - it immediately caught our interest after having watched a couple of documentaries on the country of Myanmar and reading about its politics in recent news articles on NPR.  It was an easy drive with convenient parking, and we were greeted with very nice service - the waitress seemed equally as appreciated with us as customers as we were with the food!  A nice, quiet setting to enjoy some talk with a friend over some unique and exotic cuisine.  We ordered the Royal Myanmar tea, which was very delicious, and quite essential for a cold day.  We also ordered the sampler appetizer, but substituted it with three fried green squash and three tofu, as we didn't want meat and they were out of samosa at the time.  The appetizer was served with a very tasty sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  I ordered the pickled tea leaf salad (as I had heard it is a very good traditional Burmese specialty with all the right balanced eats from herbs to veggies to crunchies) and my boyfriend ordered the drinking noodles with chicken.  The salad was like nothing I've ever had before and was very tasty!  It had a salty and savory flavor; a sufficient yet lighter meal, which I enjoy.  The drinking noodles are awesome according to my boyfriend; a good mix of savory sauce with the addition of bitter vegetables.  We very much enjoyed our time at Royal Myanmar - they have great what I assume to be more culturally traditional brass band music playing, creating a nice atmosphere for a calm, lighthearted afternoon outing.  Again, the service was absolutely amazing - I definitely recommend this unique eatery to anyone with an open mind and passion for Asian food and culture.  Fantastic sushi. Excellent customer service. Amazing prices! We will be regulars. I can't believe we waited so long to try them out. Ashamed to say we live right around the corner. \r\nWe had the tempura shrimp, the spicy tuna, and a chicken coconut curry. Perfect.  Fantastic Food, great service! \r\n\r\nThis was our first time at Myanmar Cuisine. Foot at Royal Myanmar is really good. We tried some Sushi, Different Appetizers and couple of entrees and found everything really good. \r\n\r\nWe had never tasted Fried Tofu this well! Samosa and Chicken Satay were really good! Basil Chicken was our favorite main course. \r\n\r\nAll the food seemed to have been cooked really healthy. Very less oil, fresh ingredients. Multiple options for lower carbs diets as well. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for an upscale elite decor place, this is not the one for you. But best bang for your buck from the friendly people with healthy and fresh food, search no more!  This place is tucked away in a little corner across from dunkin donuts. We were greeted immediately upon entering and sat very quickly. Service was excellent. They have a good sushi selection, not too overwhelming. We tried the dragon roll, royal Myanmar roll and sashimi platter. Everything was delicious. The prices are ridiculously good. Overall, excellent service, quiet atmosphere, very casual, great prices, very good food.  OK the fried tofu is to die for!  We got a sampler appetizer platter the Royal Myanmar combination. They make their own tofu from scratch with chick peas. And they must work some kind of magic on them because I don't really like chick peas.  We also tried the broil Myanmar tea, and the Thai iced tea. Both were excellent. Spartan atmosphere but the food makes up for it.  Delicious food. From appetizers to salads  to dinners, the food  here is wonderful.   I'm not sure what characterizes Burmese food but the names of many dishes on the menu are familiar from Chinese,  Thai and Indian restaurants.  The chickpea tofu was wonderful  and I'd actually prefer it to soy tofu.   I also recommend samosas, pad Thai, spicy fried rice (nice big shrimp).  Service very accommodating, for example, modification to make a dish vegetarian.  Prices reasonable to a tad high.  BYOB.  Ambience is not this restaurant's best quality.  There is a lot more to explore on the menu.  Highly recommend.  I was excited to check this place out for their sushi. I got a spicy tuna roll and the mynamar roll. They go extremely heavy on the "special sauce" they put on top of the rolls. So much so that I found myself scraping it off because it was too excessive. I\'ve always read that if a place overloads on the sauce, the sushi underneath is probably not that great.  Went here for the first time. Started off with the Kim Chi Kyee Gae soup which is a Kim Chi spicy soup that was really good and spicy. Then a fresh salad with ginger dressing. We ordered Lemmongrass beef with coconut rice and Kauk Swe Kyaw. The beef was fall apart tender and delicious in a lemon broth. The Kauk Swe Kyaw is a noodle dish with vegetables and egg.with your choice of meat. It is a spicy dish. \r\n\r\nThe person that waited on us was very helpful and patient with our questions. Great place and fair prices and I will be back.  We went here tonight for the first time.  We loved it and will be back soon!  We did takeout but would like to try and dine-in next time.  I hope others hear about this place and patronize it so we can keep this gem in west view.  Hard to believe this place is a block from our house and we didn't even know it. Now we're going to have a problem with access to good sushi and Thai food on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nStarted with the typical house salad with ginger dressing - much more flavorful ginger than most Chinese restaurants.\r\n\r\nFollowed up with two sushi rolls: rainbow and west view roll, perfectly prepared and both $10.\r\n\r\nFor entrees I had the spicy basil chicken and my wife had the coconut curry with LARGE portions of chicken breast. Excellent portion sizes and absolutely delicious. Ordered a 7 on the spice scale and it was perfect for me - enough to make my nose run.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say it's a hidden gem in West View.  The BEST sushi! I have had several different sushi rolls from here many times and have not had a bad experience yet. It's so fresh, delicious and well priced. I prefer this sushi over anything I've tried at upscale restaurants downtown! This is my go - to take out!  Holy heck, I love this place. My fianc\xc3\xa9 and I were a little thrown off when we walked in. It's small and very quiet and only one other person was inside eating. So glad we decided to stay! The service is fast(so fast) and the food is good. Side note, Thai iced tea is AMAZING. \r\nI stayed with sushi and my fianc\xc3\xa9 got a basil chicken dish. Not disappointed at all. \r\nWe just moved into the area a month ago and have already made a second trip! Don't let the outside fool you, it hides between a karate place and a laundry mat and the long blinds hide the inside. \r\nRecommend.  Great food, friendly people and reasonable prices. I have never been disappointed with any of my many meals there! The portions are great, too. If you want good sushi, come here!! I do feel bad that there's barely anyone who eats in, but I think they're doing well for themselves!  A no frills local restaurant with excellent, delicious food. They offer both traditional Burmese food as well as a pan Asian-American menu and sushi. Great for both take out and a casual sit down meal  This place is amazing. I've only recently discovered it even though it is right in my neighborhood. I've had 3 different dishes so far and believe it or not each one is not only excellent but some of the best food I've ever tasted. I would  definitely put this restaurant on your must try list. Don't be put off by the lack of decor but get ready for the friendliest service and the best tasting food you've ever had!  Try the curry. I had the chicken and potato curry it was awesome.  Burmese food in West View. Crazy! I've been ordering 2-3 different dishes a week since it opened. The chicken dishes are really solid. Lots of great non-Americanized dishes on the menu.  Wonderful Asian restaurant! Not too Americanized so food is fresh and healthy! They have Burmese and Thai dishes and a sushi bar if you're craving sushi. Ordered the  Myanmar combo sampler - chicken satay was amazing, crispy tofu was perfect and the samosas the best I've ever had. For entrees, the chicken Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw was good (think peanut-less pad Thai with chick peas) and the Spicy Basil Beef was delicious. Huge menu, we'll be back to try and sample everything. \r\nThey gave us a free soup and salad since we ate in - \r\nFinished with mango sticky rice - which was legit (mango was amazing). Support them so we can keep this gem in the area!  I don't judge a book by it's cover when it comes to Asian restaraunts, but maybe I should start.  This place is very drab looking from the outside in.  It was also very cold when we were there, so I wanted to leave very soon after we ate for fear of freezing to death.  The lady that served us was very nice, but the food was nothing to write home about.  We both had stomach aches and had indigestion after eating there.  My gf had the only vegan menu item, which was their curried vegetable plate.  I had some of it and it was very bland.  I couldn't taste any of the curry spices at all.  I would like to say that I would try it again, but I really don't think I would drive to West Veiw again for their food.  Especially when there are so many restaraunts with the same kind of food, but much better quality and taste.  Also, the problem is that I don't eat sushi and I am not that into seafood as well.  I love this place.  It's fresh, affordable and no frills.  The owner is the most flexible with substitutions and the sashimi platter is so good.  They take credit cards, are great for lunch and there are plenty of seats. Parking is plentiful and we love eating here.  Try the sashimi platter!  Finally... I\'ve been wanting to check this place out for months! With all the rave reviews, and also the lack of Burmese food in Pittsburgh, I was super excited to check it out. A little venture to West View never hurt nobody, right? \r\n\r\nThe place is not fancy, but it\'s not necessary when you have delicious food and friendly service! We were the only ones in on a Tuesday night, but hopefully that will change as more people hear how great it is!\r\n\r\nWe pretty much stuffed ourselves with everything that was recommended as authentic Burmese. We started with the Royal Myanmar combination sampler, which was somosas, chicken satay and crispy tofu. Plus we ordered the squash fritter. Everything in the platter was okay, but that chili sauce really added to it all. The fritters were a little bland unfortunately (the sauce fixed that right up!). \r\n\r\nThe main dishes were really the fab! We ordered the Coconut Chicken Curry, Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw and Lemongrass Beef. The beef we were told, is slow cooked all day, so it was seriously just falling to pieces as you picked it up. The chicken was the same in terms of cooked to perfection. And both sauces were incredible. \r\n\r\nThe beef came with coconut rice... which I\'d opt for instead of regular rice any day! The coconut rice specifically only comes with a handful of dishes and isn\'t listed as a side. I\'d definitely see if you can order it instead of the regular rice if you can though! \r\n\r\nThe Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw was good, but I could have done with a little more flavor. I love noodle though, so I\'m interested to come back and check out the other noodle dishes. We thought about ordering sushi, but didn\'t. I\'d also be interested to see how that is. Basically what I"m saying is, I"ll absolutely be back. All that food we ordered came to around $60 and it was a feast! Can\'t wait for the next feast...  It should be filled with people. My husband had The sushi,. It was fresh, good quality, and a very nice presentation. The Spring rolls are pretty fabulous.I had a tofu curry dish, it was just OK. It had a chicken broth base. Didn't taste much like cumin or curry. I would try them again, when I decide to eat meat.  The sushi here is great. One of the best places around. The staff is super friendly and accommodating.  This restaurant is a must-try! The food is phenomenal. Everything is well made with the utmost care. We had the sampler platter, Thai tea, and sushi. The staff was so kind. We felt bad after getting there on the later side (930pm), but she reassured us there were no worries. Excellent server. Took Mango rice dessert home - still too stuffed from all the awesome to try it yet! I'm not super good at reviews, but I can't wait to go back again.  Good food.   Like being invited to an Asian friend's home.    Sampler was great.   Spicy basil chicken was good, but the lemongrass beef missed the mark :(.   It would have been tastier if it came in smaller pieces.   The beef wasn't tender, and I could really taste the coconut in the coconut rice...it just tastes like white rice.   4 stars for unpretentious decor, good service, Thai sweet tea, and the sampler :)  Being vegetarian we were skeptical initially but all others Indian restaurants were closed at that time (4 pm). When went there, we instantly liked the place and the very warm welcome. There were so many vegetarian choices. First she served salad with ginger sauce. We had amazing samosas with sauce, super duper fried rice with rightly fried tofu and rice is well done as well as tasty chewy, classic veg curry with coconut sauce which is out of the world, veggie noddles and what not. Superb food. Excellent service. Reasonably priced. I would rate it as a five any day!  Ordered some chicken basil and I have to tell you it was delicious ! Full of flavor and fresh, may be the best one I had so far  ! Definitely getting this again during my next visit and some sushi platter !  Yet another delicious visit to Royal Myanmar. This time, we dive right into this amazing plate of sushi featuring three rolls and 10 pieces of nigiri (of your choosing). Wowzers! It was so good and at $40?! Best value in this area. We had to have that addictive samosa thoke again. So unique and flavorful. Love it.  Delicious food, great prices and portions. My favorite dish is the spicy basil fried rice and I ask for the heat to be about a 6, which is perfect! The sushi is great too.  I can't wait to order more, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  If you want authentic Asian food in Pittsburgh, look no further. Real crab meat in their sushi!! \r\n\r\nI have tried different things on their menu and each time blown away! Rice dish was authentic not Americanize. Sushi was fresh. Also called to make a last minute order for a sushi platter for an office party.  It was beautifully presented and was a popular item ;) gone in minutes.\r\n\r\nKeep up the awesome job Royal Myanmar ;)  We returned last week to dine-in for a weekday lunch. The food was spot on and we had a wonderful time. I can't wait for our next visit!  Never expected to find a legit Burmese place in Pittsburgh. So happy to see a place that offers different kind of Burmese noodle that I haven't ever tried - boiled egg noodle with chicken, rice vermicelli soup with meatball and quail eggs, and I also got the stir fried egg noodle with pork. My drive from my hotel all the way on the southern suburbs, passing all the traffics, was totally worth it! I'll come back to try the dishes next time.  Don't let the Spartan decor fool you, the food here is seriously good.  My wife and I split an appetizer of chicken satay skewers.  We got 3 large skewers, expertly cooked, tender, juicy and delicious. The peanut cucumber side sauce was a nice compliment.\r\n\r\nFor dinner we had the Royal Myanmar noodle soup and Pork Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw.  The soup was delicious in a flavorful but mildly spiced chicken broth.  The pork Nyat was spiced to taste (I went with 5 on a scale of ten) and was hearty and delicious.\r\n\r\nIt's BYOB so if you want alcohol, bring it.\r\n\r\nDinner for 2 was $26 before tip, which given quality of the food was a screaming bargain.  Worth a trip.  3.5 for this place only because my two girlfriends and I agreed we have had better sushi, it was a tiny bit heavy, and the ambience of the restaurant could use a little work.  Don't get me wrong the sushi was excellent and fresh, great price for the amount of food they give you and our service was attentive but not invasive.  I would definitely come back to this little hidden gem.  It is centrally located in West View not far off of McKnight and just about 15 minutes from my office..so that's convenient.\r\n\r\nWe weren't sure if this was a BYOB and I forgot to call, but when two of us arrived we saw a sign so we ran to the liquor store down the street and grabbed a bottle before our third person showed.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, the young boy, I assume someones son, was sitting at a table and politely instructed us to seat ourselves. It was so cute!!I don't believe there was a corking fee and the inside of place was pretty simple.  Only one other table was taken when we got there, but by the time we left, most every table was occupied.  \r\n\r\nBetween the three of us, we had the West View Roll, Center Ave Roll, Shrimp Tempura, California Roll, California Roll and one other I cant remember the name.  We had two portions of edamame which was more than enough to share.  Each dish came with the side ginger salad which was crisp and fresh with a ginger dressing that had a lot of peanut flavor - which I liked.  Our bills were extremely reasonable with each roll being under $10 each (which is extremely rare from what I have found at other sushi restaurants).  They had really awesome large combination plates to share with anywhere from 15-60 pieces of sushi that were also really reasonably priced.\r\n\r\nI would love to come back and try other things on the menu as well as more sushi options!  So glad we stopped in!  Good service. Had small sushi plates. Just the right size sushi bite. Reasonably priced. Will try Burmese next time.  Excellent sushi! Had the West View Roll along with the Royal Myanmar Tea and it was awesome. Perfect lunch and great service.  Very good food, enjoyed the chicken curry and appetizer sampler.  Certainly different, but very good.  I will be back.  \xe5\x9c\xa8village\xe7\x9a\x84\xe4\xb8\x80\xe5\xae\xb6\xe5\xba\x97\xe3\x80\x82\xe6\x80\xa7\xe4\xbb\xb7\xe6\xaf\x94\xe5\xbe\x88\xe9\xab\x98\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xb8\x9c\xe8\xa5\xbf\xe4\xb9\x9f\xe5\xbe\x88\xe5\xa5\xbd\xe5\x90\x83\xe3\x80\x82\xe6\x9c\x8d\xe5\x8a\xa1\xe5\x91\x98\xe6\x98\xaf\xe9\x9d\x9e\xe5\xb8\xb8\xe9\x9d\x9e\xe5\xb8\xb8\xe6\xb8\xa9\xe6\x9f\x94\xe7\x9a\x84Asian,\xe6\x89\x93\xe6\x89\xae\xe7\x9a\x84\xe5\xbe\x88\xe5\x87\xba\xe8\x89\xb2\xef\xbc\x8c\xe5\x88\xb0\xe5\xba\x95\xe6\x98\xaf\xe5\x9c\xa8village,\xe7\x9c\x8b\xe4\xbb\x96\xe4\xbb\xac\xe7\xab\xaf\xe7\x9b\x98\xe5\xad\x90\xe6\x98\xaf\xe4\xbb\xb6\xe5\xbe\x88\xe4\xba\xab\xe5\x8f\x97\xe7\x9a\x84\xe4\xba\x8b\xe6\x83\x85\xe3\x80\x82 I love these Asian waiters!!!\r\n\r\n\xe5\xa5\xbd\xe4\xba\x86 \xe6\xb2\xa1\xe6\x9c\x89\xe5\xa4\xaa\xe5\xa4\x9a\xe8\xa6\x81\xe8\xaf\xb4\xe7\x9a\x84\xe7\x9a\x84\xe4\xba\x86\xe6\xb1\x82\xe4\xbd\xa0\xe4\xba\x86\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\x87\x91\xe5\xad\x97\xe6\x95\xb0  Food is good!!!\r\nBut we waited for more than an hour! Better don't be too hungry if you go here. It wasn't even very crowed... Maybe ask how long you'll have to wait before being seated ;)  This was a highlight of my time in Montreal. The service was impeccable, the wines available were great and the food was unparalleled. I'd never had Burmese food before, but I will be searching NYC for a similar authenticity. Worth every penny and more.  Wow! How have I lived this long without knowing how wonderful Burmese food can be?!\r\n\r\nI enjoyed a fabulous meal tonight, from appetizers through to dessert. It was obvious from the first bite great attention had been paid to the details. Each dish was full of fascinating flavours. And I particularly loved all of the elaborate textures. The meal was a feast for the senses!  While the restaurant serves a variety of meat dishes, it is also incredibly friendly to vegans and vegetarians, which I greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThe vibe of the restaurant was relaxed and lovely. The staff was attentive and gracious as so many others have said.\r\n\r\nDagon is a great addition not only to the restaurant scene in The Village, but for Montreal as a whole.  C'\xc3\xa9tait bon mais attendre plus de 40 minutes pour avoir notre plat de servis apr\xc3\xa8s nos 3 samousas en entr\xc3\xa9e, non merci ...  We decided to try the new Dagon (not dragon) Restaurant in Montreal, and had a lovely and memorable dinner.   Tala (one of the owners) greeted us warmly and made us feel very welcome.  All of the waiters were friendly, knew the dishes and were quietly attentive.  (Did I mention good-looking?) The restaurant was attractive, calming, and decorated simply but effectively.  The restaurant had just got its' BYOB license, so we were able to bring our own wine.  We enjoyed sharing the appetizer, main course dishes and dessert.\r\nWe hadn't eaten Burmese food before, and found everything tender, nicely spiced and delicious.  Overall it had excellent service, very tasty and interesting food, and turned into an evening to remember.  We will be back.  My wife and I were enjoying a beautiful Sunday afternoon walking down St Catherine and we came across Dagon. We were supper psyched to have stumbled across a Burmese resto. They weren\'t open yet but we made a point to come back later in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nWhen we arrived the terrace had just filled up and we got the first table inside. We ordered some food and then we waited. After about 30 min our appetizer arrived. After another 30 minutes our food had still not arrived, which wasn\'t ideal but we were having a good time and noticed that a few spots had opened up on the terrace. So, I asked our server if we could move outside to one of the available tables. She said that she would have to check with the manager and then didn\'t come back. So I asked the manager myself and was told that it would not be possible for us to move to the terrace as those spaces were only available on a "first come first serve" basis. I pointed out that we had been there for over an hour and still ad not received our order. Still it was not possible for us to move to an available table outside. \r\n\r\nWE really didn\'t think that this was an acceptable level of service, so we decided we woudl pay for our appetizer and leave.  Needless to say we won\'t be back .  My first Burmese food experience- a mix of curry, lemongrass and other typical southeast Asian cuisine. Asked for medium spice but not spicy at all, And so I question the authenticity of the cuisine- not that I know how real Burmese food tastes like, but according to my childhood memory during my 1-week visit in Burma, there are a lot more exotic ingredients & flavours than a simple plain beef curry, fish curry or a stir-fly noodle that taste like westernized pad Thai, etc. However, I would still recommend it if you want a comfort home-cooking Asian food place in the village that serve wines at only $5 more than SAQ - and can always count it as a backup plan for your group when Red Tiger is full.  Honestly a great meal. First time trying Burmese food and I was very impressed. The staff was very friendly and made me want to come back! Highly recommend.  I checked out this new village restaurant for lunch today. I'd never had Burmese before, and was curious. The space is done up very nicely; it's simple, but a clean and appealing environment. The service is very friendly. They have a great and reasonably priced lunch menu, that includes a starter, rice and a homemade drink along with your main. Everything was excellent. The food tasted homemade and the meat was perfectly cooked and tender. They are putting care into their food and into their restaurant, and it really shows! I will be back.  The food was good but we waited too long. We went there at 6:15 and we were planning to go to watch the drag queens at 7:30. There was no way that we expected to be late. But they managed to do that... \r\nHowever, the food was good. If you have plenty of time, then it will be great.  We ate dinner here tonight Sept 8. My spouse and I shared six items: Baya Kyaw, Lat Phet Tok, Pumpkin Curry aux Crevettes, Coconut Rice, and Banana Fritters with vanilla ice cream. All these dishes were exceptionally good except the Baya Kyaw, which we both thought was okay but not outstanding.\r\nThis restaurant was a lucky choice for us two visitors from San Francisco. Be sure to try the pumpkin curry with shrimp, and the La Phet Tom (fermented tea leaves, small peas, lettuce, grilled ground nuts, and sesame).  Pretty good Burmese restaurant.  Started out with the chickpea fritters which were a bit dry and bland.  Ordered the chicken curry with cocoanut rice and it was very good.  The tilapia curry was a bit fishy tasting.  Service was very friendly, the interior was very nice and prices aren't anything to complain about.  I would have given this restaurant five stars if it wasn't for the long wait. The weather was perfect, we were seated outside so we didn't mind the long wait (It took an hour or so to get our plates). The food is very good, I enjoyed the level of spices and the mix of the ingredients. We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared between six of us. My favorite is lemongrass fish, very well done. I would go back and recommend it though if you are in a hurry for a quick bite, this is not a good spot.  Second time in Montreal and i finally made it to Dagon. Service wasnt as bad as everyone else claimed it to be. We sat outside and had pretty decent service. My pumpkin soup was more like a stew, but was delicious. the rice was cooked well, but honestly had barely any coconut flavor. The meal over all was good, but nothing to wow me.  We tried Dagon because we have never had the chance to eat Burmese food. The service was impeccable! Our waiter explained the menu and what to expect (spices similar to Indian and Asian food, but combined a bit differently), and was helpful in suggesting what to order.  The restaurant itself was lovely--plenty of privacy while maintaining an open feel.  We enjoyed the meal, and would definitely go back again.  Tastes good.. But extremely slow service \r\nVeg samosa are good for appetizer . Chicken curry with rice is good . Fish curry with tomato sauce tastes regular like a home made dish .  If you like Indian, Thai, asian food - you need to give this place a chance as they provide you with a beautiful culinary experience. I am absolutely in love with this little restaurant in the gay village. The Swiss owner explained to me that he opened the restaurant with a family from Myanmar (Burma) whom he originally met at a refugee camp in Thailand. All the recipes are from this family and the authentic versions of what you would eat in this country. So here\'s about my 5 \xc3\xa0 7 that became a "6 \xc3\xa0 11"!\r\n\r\nNow, let\'s talk about the food: "Kaw Pyant" this crunchy vegetarian spring roll was delicious, juicy and so flavourful. "Ohn Noh Kaut Swae" My friend really enjoyed this curry\\/coconut noodle soup. I tried the curry and it tasted just how curry should taste. What I liked from the menu is that you could make more than half of the plates vegan or vegetarian. It was very hard to choose something in the menu because everything looked fantastic, but I ended up trying the eggplant curry with the coconut rice "Kayan Thee Nhat". It was a tasty but simple dish with only the eggplant mixed with its spices - going forward, I would share this dish with another plate that has more greens (I\'m vegan guys - need to see some greens! lol).  \r\n\r\nWines on the menu are selected by the owner, are not expensive and good! (Obvious win for me!)\r\n\r\nThe fried banana + ice cream was just the way you would want to end your experience.The semolina cake is for those of you who don\'t like sweet things. Coffee comes with a little cookie you can dip (make sure to dip it as it truly enhances the taste of the cookie - for coffee lovers only!).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, my friend and I stayed until 11 pm, when we asked the staff and realized the place closed at 10:30 pm, the staff offered to stay longer if we wanted - such a kind and generous gesture but we decided to leave and thanked them for being so welcoming - 5 on 5 for making your visitors feel comfortable! \r\n\r\nBon app\xc3\xa9tit all!  Cuisine fine, accueil parfait, r\xc3\xa9servation conseill\xc3\xa9e, l'un des meilleurs (sinon le meilleur) restos du Village.  Great surprise!\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't take the time to write a lot of reviews but when I do it's because I think it really deserves it and is exceptional! Try it, the Birman food they serve is very good, it is a little bit similar to Indian but more fine. For the place and the quality of the food I say it's pretty cheap. Try it you wont regret I promise!  Restaurant dont la cuisine est d\xc3\xa9licieuse. Nous avons d\xc3\xbb r\xc3\xa9server au pr\xc3\xa9alable et c'est fortement conseill\xc3\xa9 !\r\nDes plats succulents, un service \xc3\xa0 la hauteur. La salle ne comprend pas tant de table que cela et la terrasse n'est pas ouverte si la temp\xc3\xa9rature ext\xc3\xa9rieure n'est pas suffisante. \r\n\r\nUn must de Montreal et du village !  The food was hit or miss but the service was terrible.  The kitchen was unable to get things out in a reasonable time frame.  Appetizers took 30+ minutes.  After 1 hour we received the rice that comes with our meal.  It took almost 1.5 hours to get a main dish for 4 people.  Several parties just got up and left.  The shrimp and pumpkin was awful--overcooked, rubbery shrimp. The only thing that seemed decent on our table were the ribs.  Additionally we paid about $25\\/person so it really was not worth it.  What \xc3\xa0 Nice terrasse to sit and have Dinner In the heart of St Catherine's St.... Not only a nice outdoor and service, but the food is an explosion of flavors ... I had the spicy beef curry with coconut rice and it was Delicioussssss... My friends adore their plate too... You might have a little wait to get your plate but it is definitely worth it!  I've been here several times, lunch, dinner, with company and alone, the food doesn't disappoint. \r\n\r\nVegan perspective: They actually know what vegan is and they always have a few great dishes to offer.\r\n\r\nService: Can be a little slow, and I've twice had parties arriving after me served first (no comment on motivation). Discounting one star for that.  Kudos for this restaurant being VERY close to a metro on a rainy day, not to mention that this was a perfect opportunity for me to explore what Burmese food consisted of; and I was definitely pleased. The host was very warm and the atmosphere was pretty pleasant. I appreciated that they indicated in their menu precisely the ingredients in every one of their plates & also marked if whether or not they contained nuts, spices ( medium or very spicy) and if some were vegetarian.  Even during a late busy afternoon, the staff would still ask us if everything was okay and would chat comfortably with us despite the fact that they may have had a pretty long day. The food was worth the price as it was unique in its own genre. I\'m glad to say that Dagon wasn\'t this "Typical Asian" restaurant were they westernized their plates and its names: they did their best to preserve its authenticity. I, for one, am a teenage student and would recommend this place to anyone regardless their age.  Wouldn't recommend - not a very busy evening and we had to wait over an hour to get our food, which when it did arrive was lukewarm. Won't be heading back there again.  Everything was succulent, flavorful, freshly prepared and the service was attentive and kind.  I loved my noodles and it was spiced perfectly.  I would eat there everyday if possible.  Dining outside and watching passersby was a highlight on a beautifully temperate evening.  Maybe they were just having an off-night. It was a Friday night, and I went by myself. There were two other couples sitting in the restaurant. I was seated at a table on the wall, where where was a baseboard heater that nearly burned my leg it was so hot. Even after I moved the table away from the wall, it was still very uncomfortable. I ordered an appetizer and a main course. The appetizer, a salad, took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. The restaurant was nearly empty, and no one was coming in for pick-up orders. My main course, chicken in what was supposed to be a spicy and fragrant curry sauce, was dry as a bone, and the sauce bland. Perhaps, coming from a larger metropolis, I am accustomed to different Burmese food, or they could have been having an off-night.  So you think that in a city of 8.2 million people there is at least a way to keep a single Burmese restaurant alive - but alas, over the past 3 years we have seen 3 Burmese places drop dead in New York City - one in the village (Village Mingala), one in Queens and the final one happened on the Upper East Side.  Looks like the second avenue subway construction finally put the nail in the coffin for my beloved Mangala, and with that, Burmese restaurants become extinct in the Big Apple.  Where am I going to get my la phet and mohinga fix?!\r\n\r\nMontreal has a population of 1.7 million (just like Philadelphia), and even though the restaurant scene is famously over-saturated and places constantly die, they manage to kill off only one burmese joint (Ruby Burma on the Main, RIP).  Well, that leaves us with one - Dagon.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of location, it's near Metro Papineau on the green line.  Get off the station, ponder the irony of the mural of a Catholic priest in a gay friendly area, and then look around.   You should be on St Catherine Street East and the Metro super-marche\\/Cartier bridge will be in front of you.  Turn around and walk 3 blocks until you get to Champlain street (it's on the corner).  Alternatively the 15\\/St Catherine bus stops at the end of the block.  \r\n\r\nNow, as for decor and service - Check out the light fixtures with the Asian umbrella motif, the coat rack and the typical wooden tables and chairs.  Comfy, but not homey.  During the evening we visited there was only one waiter manning the entire operation, and I am guessing there is only another person in the back doing the kitchen work, rather typical of smaller Montreal restaurants.  Sure, the service is slow, but then I would argue that Montrealites tend to dine slow anyways.  Bring a bottle of red, engage in a conversation, etc.  If it's a Saturday or a Sunday most shops will be closed past 5 or 6p anyways, so it's not like there is a massive rush to do something else.   Don't be an American dick and rush, rush, rush.  \r\n\r\nNow, as for the food?  Well, the quality is more difficult to ascertain as I only had about 3 reference points - the Mingalas in New York and a Mohinga joint in Macau.  That being said, I wish that they are more detailed with the menu descriptions.  For example, chickpea fritters.  In Burma the locals create a tofu analog called tophu (the Burmese language do not have an f sound, so the best way to salute a policeman will be to tell him to phuck off), which is typically fried and cut into slices - in certain places it's also referred to as a chickpea fritter.  The item that I received was essentially like a pakora, except with chopped deep fried chickpeas.  Not quite the same.  As for the tea leaf salad (La Phet), it's missing some ingredients that I am accustomed to.  The Mohinga is pretty good, though.  Not quite the fresh fish version with Vermicelli that I am used to, but still very good.  You can taste the lemongrass (a bit light though) and coconut flavors in the curry flavors.  The Yangon beef is a short rib stew with the asian clove\\/masala kick, and the herbed rice is essentially a biryani - a spiced rice pilaf with fruits and nuts that goes well with the stew in question.  Portion is a little small for the price, but it's gay village.  Things are generally not that cheap here.  Overall, not a disappointment, but not a revelation either.  \r\n\r\nSo yeah, I would not joneze about it back in NYC, and I might not even stop by the next time I end up at YUL, but hey, it's good to know it exists.  Wonderful!\r\n\r\nNow I'm not saying folks should do this, but as it happened my friend rod and I entered this place at 9:45pm having mis-read the sign thinking they closed at 11pm. No, their closing time was 10!  But the host (so sad I didn't get his name!) - and I assume son of the owners, who I also assume are the chefs - greeted us warmly and with genuine welcome and respect for our presence.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked whether they were closing, he explained that the kitchen closes at 10, but the front generally stays open if there are people.\r\n\r\nFrom that point forward, service was genuinely warm, thoughtful and inviting. We ordered the tea-leaf salad, lentil soup, beef curry and vegetable curry.  All very delicious, boldly flavored and well-balanced.  The food is good and I will definitely recommend this place and come here again.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance was very clean, clearly mindfully tended and a testament to the attentiveness of the owners.\r\n\r\nOverall, the experience of dining at The Dragon was rich and a beautiful way to spend American Thanksgiving!  De loin le meilleur resto dans le village. Nourriture excellente, prix raisonnable m\xc3\xaame pour le vin. Excellent service, sympathique et belle terrasse aussi. \r\nBy far the best restaurant in the village. Amazing food and good prices, even for the wine.  Dagon. As in I'm going to eat now at this dagon restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis is the only Burmese restaurant I've found outside of the Burmese restaurant-obsessed Bay Area. Granted I didn't look everywhere, but it bears mentioning that none showed up in my Yelp search of New York City. (Update: I did find some in a Yelp search in the greater LA area.)\r\n\r\nWe tested Dagon against the 20 Bay Area Burmese restaurants we've visited and Dagon held its own.\r\n\r\nWe started with the Crispy Bean Sprout and Shrimp appetizer. This was the husband's favorite dish. I liked it a lot but felt like it was a lot of fried. To their credit it wasn't overly oily.\r\n\r\nThe tea leaf salad was quite good. However, I recommend to the owners if you're reading this to add some presentation to this dish. At every Bay Area Burmese restaurant the ingredients are all identified by the server as the salad is mixed tableside.\r\n\r\nI'd never had lentil soup at a Burmese restaurant. Would it be like dal? It ended up being like something else entirely. My husband thought too salty, I thought just right. My daughter and I liked it a lot. \r\n\r\nWe were tempted by the Nan Gyi Toke, a favorite dish of ours, but wanted to branch out and try the Shan Kaut Swae - noodles with chicken and shan pickles. We'd never seen it on a menu before and thought we'd try something new. It was our least favorite - though still good! - and I'm glad we got it.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting trying new dishes that we don't see in the Bay Area. We sat outside on a deck on the street on the warm night. It felt like we waited a long time for food, but I think that was because all the food arrived at the same time, instead of the appetizer and salad arriving first like I would expect.\r\n\r\nKathy's Burmese Rankings (All in the Bay Area Unless Otherwise Noted)\r\n\r\n1 (tie) Rangoon Ruby, Palo Alto and San Carlos\r\n1 (tie) Burma Ruby, Palo Alto (same owner as Rangoon Ruby)\r\n4) Mandalay, San Francisco\r\n5) Burma Superstar, Oakland\r\n6) Best of Burma, San Mateo\r\n7) Burma Love, San Francisco\r\n8) Yangon, Burlingame\r\n9) DAGON, MONTREAL\r\n10) Rangoon Superstars, Berkeley\r\n11) Sweet Mango, San Jose\r\n12) Burma Bistro, Santa Clara\r\n13) Kyusu, San Jose\r\n14) Mingalaba, Burlingame\r\n15) B Star, San Francisco\r\n16) Natoma Cafe (closed), San Francisco\r\n17) Rangoon (closed), Palo Alto \r\n18) Green Elephant, Palo Alto\r\n19) Burma House, Milpitas\r\n20) Innya Lake, San Bruno\r\n21) Nan Yang, Oakland (admittedly my taste buds have evolved since I tried it - and hated it - so I might like it more now)  Great Burmese food in the Gay Village. \r\n\r\nMy husband and I happened upon this spot for a late lunch. They have a diverse lunch menu. The lunch deal includes a lemonade and a spring roll, both of which really hit the spot. \r\n\r\nOur main dishes were very different but both very good. I would say the chicken dish was a little more unique, but the coconut curry with noodles was also very good. \r\n\r\nThe people who work here were very nice and interesting to chat with about the Burmese population in Montreal, which is minimal.  Un de mes restaurants favoris de montr\xc3\xa9al. La nourriture typique est excellente, les prix sont abordables, le service tr\xc3\xa8s rapide et le vin que quelques dollars au dessus de la SAQ. On adore :)  I absolutely love it here!!! My fave is the Chicken Noodle Soup - soul warming soup with a chick pea base. Very unique flavour, very delicious. I also love the fried noodle dish. The lady here is very accommodating, just ask and she'll probably make it for you!  This is my first time trying Burmese food and I'm in love. We had the coconut soup and the green tea salad. Both super yummy. The soup was creamy and comforting while the salad was spicy and fresh. We live in Toronto but will definitely make the drive to try more things next time. Just make sure to have cash or debit, they don't take credit. And don't be in a hurry. Everything is clearly made fresh to order and it's worth the wait.  A friend told me to find a Burmese restaurant and have a tea leaf salad. This is, surprisingly, the only restaurant in Toronto to offer a tea leaf salad. IT WAS SPECTACULAR. The salad was flavorful, and the owner was super kind in explaining Burmese traditions to me.  Royal Myanmar has warm, welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable staff on Burmese cuisine. The tea leave salad was filling with sugared nuts, seeds, roasted chickpeas, cumin, lettuce, onions, and oily dressing. The menu is filled with traditional Burmese dishes, or so I have been told they were traditional Burmese food. I tried the fried rice with yellow peas, which was slightly on the plain side. However, I am grateful to have tried this traditional yellow pea Burmese fried rice (rice had a pillow-like softness to it). Soup and mango salad came with the fried rice. I enjoyed the mango salad and the soup. The yellow  pea fried rice was dissimilar to the soy sauce based Chinese fried rice. \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant resembles a home with tan painted walls and overall very clean. I definitely recommend anyone to try this Burmese restaurant out!  The Royal Myanmar Restaurant is a nice, quaint, no frills type restaurant located in away from the hustle and bustle in Etobicoke. The service is really friendly and helpful (it was our first experience with Burmese food). They made great recommendations... This is what we ordered:\r\n\r\nBurmese Mixed Salad\xc2\xa0(A Thoke Sone) \r\nBurmese Style Beef Curry (AmmethaHinn) \r\nCoconut Chicken w\\/ Noodle & Fresh Vegetables (Shwetaung Kauk Swe) \r\nBurmese coconut jelly (hsa*ba)\r\n\r\nI enjoyed all the items listed above, especially the beef dish. I would suggest asking them to spice it up a bit... :)  I have been wanting to try Burmese food for some time and was pleasantly surprised when I found out this restaurant was so close to home!  Full of flavour and excellent vegetarian options. You just have to ask and they will make it.  First Bangladeshi cuisine now Burmese cuisine, what good fortune to find such amazingly delicious food one behind another! \r\n\r\nOmmar, the owner, was a perfect host. She (yes "she") explained the food, preparation, what to pair together and the manner on how to eat it. Even though she grew up in Canada, she lived with her grandparents who taught her about traditional Burmese cooking; Ingredients are imported all the way from Burma (Myanmar). It\'s a family business where the aunt and nieces all help out and they\'re all just sweet as pie.\r\n\r\nWe tried:\r\n-N3 Shwe Toung Kauk Swe - Noodle with Chicken, coconut. You need to mix it well so the sauce will be well incorporated with the noodles, bean sprouts and chicken. Great textures with the crunchy bean spouts and fried noodles, soft home made noodles and savoury sauce. I added the lime and crushed chili peppers (flavorful and mildly spicy) to add to the complexity  of the dish.\r\n- E3 Ammetha Hinn (Burmese Style Beef Curry) spicy - very mild in spice even after adding the crushed chilis. Beef is tender and comes with a yummy sauce. Delicious with the coconut rice and stir fried veggies.\r\n-The Shwegyi Sanwei Makin (Burmese Semolina Cake) tasted better warmed up and would definitely go well with a hot cup of coffee or tea. The texture and taste reminded me of a Filipino Cassava Cake: thick, dense with just enough sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe owner truly values her customers. She is even willing to tweak her recipes to accommodate dietary restrictions and will even whip up something new if you\'re a regular...or if you ask her nicely. TIP - if she does make a special dish for you, take a picture of it or write down the ingredients so she can replicate it for a future visit.\r\n\r\nYou might want to call on the weekends to make sure there are available tables because people from out of town come here for the food. If you\'re one of those out of towners and you\'re running late and it\'s about closing time, just give Ommar a call and let her know and she\'ll be willing to wait for you (her words). \r\n\r\nI\'ve only used the term " Hidden Gem" only once in my Yelp lifetime. This is the real deal; if you want an authentic Burmese experience then this is your place.  Delicious, carefully prepared and home-style Burmese noodle soups and salads reflecting a cuisine that combines Indian and Chinese influences.  The prices are also extraordinarily affordable for the amount of effort and care put into the cooking ($6-7 for a bowl of noodle soup!).\r\n\r\nOrdered coconut chicken noodle soup (oh no kaut see), ginger salad (Ginn thoke) and catfish noodle soup (mohinga - classic noodle soup eaten throughout Burma).  The owner makes the rice noodles fresh and sources her ingredients locally.  The ginger salad is a combination of crunch from fried beans and toasted sesame seeds, and sour and tangy from the fermented ginger and lime and sweetness from fresh shallot slices.  Ask for fresh chilies if you order this.  The mohinga is authentic - umame broth made from catfish and banana stem slices, whole sweet shallots, and seasoned with coriander leaf, lime and crunchy fried lentil "pancake".  The oh no kaut see noodles are satisfyingly chewy, the broth creamy and tasty.  I will be back to taste other dishes in the menu.  Took the family to Royal Myanmar this weekend to finally sample this local restaurant! \r\nThe food, portions & service are just as amazing as how everyone describes, this little gem of a business is a must visit!\r\nThe dishes we ordered were mostly vegetarian except for one with shrimp for my 11 year-old, everything was superb and had a lot of flavour. Our 8 year-old is hideously picky and only ordered rice, the owner was sweet enough to make her a separate pancake-style snack, which she inhaled (THANK YOU!).\r\n\r\nRoyal Myanmar has a basket full of small kids' books, toys and interesting metal puzzles with which our kids were very busy with while waiting for our amazing food and we loved the complementary tea, very fragrant!\r\n\r\nThere is parking in front and for now, this restaurant is cash-only.  Great experience \r\nLovely service, especially Pat who explained every  dish in detail\r\nGo for Oh Noh Kauk swe or coconut noodle soup and ketthahinn and the crispy shrimp as an appetizer  \r\nWould recommend it any day\r\nCheers  We stumbled on this place when we were in the west end, and it was lunchtime and we were very hungry, but not willing to settle for just any food. We checked Yelp and decided to check this place out. We were not disappointed, the food was amazing! Don't come here looking for anything fancy, but it is clean with excellent food. I had the coconut noodle soup with tofu (instead of chicken) and my husband had the shan-style noodles. I loved the soup so much that I am still thinking about how to recreate it without driving to the other end of the city. The prices are super cheap, and I even had leftovers of my soup. My only regret is that this place wasn't open when we lived in the west end!  A tiny restaurant, with no extravagant sign or decor. They close pretty early...around 7pm, but my craving to try a new cuisine had me rush to this place. \r\nWe entered to a restaurant with only one table occupied and, what seemed like the owner, immediately and kindly greeted us and showed us to a table. \r\nI recently watched an Anthony Bourdain travel show where he visited Myanmar and highly praised a green tea salad. When I saw that they served that here too, I ordered it as an appetizer without any hesitation. For mains I got the Shan style noodles with chicken and my friend got some coconut sauce noodle dish (based on the owners recommendation). \r\nThe green tea salad arrived within a few minutes and though it may not look that amazing, I can whole heartedly say that it was the best salad I had ever tasted! I wanted the whole thing to myself and was reluctant to share. Apart from the impeccable taste, the different textures contributed so much to the experience, such as the random crunchy pieces in every bite. \r\nMy noodles were good, but nothing special to be honest. It tasted like regular Italian tomato sauce pasta. The serving size was pretty small too. My friend really enjoyed his noodles, which is what I'll try next time.\r\nA lovely restaurant, with a friendly owner. The only thing I would change is the serving size and the decor. But nevertheless, it's worth the visit!  I came here with my sister yesterday for lunch and the food is amazing.  The service was good and the owners explained their speciality good.  We tried tea leaves salad, fish noodle soup and N3.  I can't wait to come back again to try different food.  So great to have a Burmese restaurant in Toronto. It is only a few weeks old so I recommend calling ahead to check if they are open. If you're looking for authentic Burmese dishes, this is the place. We've been twice and have tried 7 dishes, they've all been great.  The food here is always made fresh. I have tried several of their dishes (my favourite being the Burmese style chicken curry). They have an authentic and home-made taste to their food which I really enjoy. The staff is super friendly too.  This is my fave food in Long Branch \\/ Alderwood. My gateway drug was the coconut chicken w\\/ noodle & fresh veg & soup (N3). So fresh and full of satisfying flavours and textures when you mix everything all together. Sprinkle some pepper flakes in there and you're all set.\r\n\r\nI've tried 4 or 5 other dishes now & have never been disappointed. The owner is super friendly and chill. The prices are very fair.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend checking this place out.  Service could be faster but I'm still giving this give stars because the food is 100% the best in the city. I live in the east end but would happily travel for hours to have the amazing khauk swe thoke. My father is Burmese and I am SO happy to finally have a Burmese restaurant in the GTA!  Really good food, even thou place doesn't look like much on the outside. Everyone is very friendly! Gives you a warm feeling of a home cooked food:)  The Yelp reviews for this place were so great that I had to check this place out. My friend and I ordered the highly recommended Green Tea leaf Salad to start off our meal and I didn't know what to expect. The first bite was interesting because there was a lot going on texture-wise but, I was totally into it. It had pieces of tomatoes in it so I let my friend have those since I'm not a fan of tomatoes. Up next was the Bean Sprout Fritters with Shrimp and I LOVED them. It came with a dipping sauce (probably tamarind) and some cucumber slivers. I was anticipating them to be really oily but they tasted really fresh and crispy. Then, we shared the Fish noodle soup and the Spicy Beef Curry which came with a simple soup, white rice and veggies. I found the soup to be bland but I see why it's needed because when I bit into one of the chopped peppers hidden in the curry, the soup acted as a palate cleanser. The fish noodle soup was tasty, I just needed to add a bit more salt. Overall, the experience was great and I would love to go back and try their other dishes.  Second time here for lunch, and I think I'll be back every day this week!! Super delicious food, friendly service, and great prices make this place the absolute best pick for food in this neighborhood. Highly recommended!  I've worked beside the restaurant for so many years but never paid attention to it. One can be easily deceived by the restaurant's simple outer appearance. On the inside however, very nice and well put together, and quite clean. I tried the Burmese Rice noodle (Shan Khaw Swe) and that turned our really well. Portions are big for at least 2 meals. I'm definitely going back to try something else.  First time having  Myanmar food and it was super so good! Had the shwe toung kauk swe & ketthaHinn. So delicious. It's kind of in the middle of no where, but it's definitely worth a try  I've been to this restaurant twice and both times the food was delicious, consistent, and authentic. Flavours are balanced; salt is balanced by tart and spice. I would give this place 5 stars based on the quality of the food, clean setting, and friendliness of staff; however food prep and service tends to be slow.  Never had Myanmar food before and really enjoyed my experience. The food is the star of this restaurant!\r\n\r\nI got the coconut noodle soup (comes with sliced boiled egg, few dark meat chicken pieces and some sliced onions). The soup is rich and coconutty; sweet and delicious! Noodles quite tender and flavours are very vibrant.\r\n\r\nThe chicken curry was delicious too- very flavourful with a mix of Chinese and Indian spices. \r\n\r\nSmall business with one lady running the front of the house. But i'd come back to try their other customer favourites! Apparently this is the only Burmese restaurant in the city!  I recently came here with my girlfriend on a Sunday evening. The service are slow but you cant go wrong with decent price for the food.  Truly love this place\r\nIn a category of it's own\r\nTry green tea salad to start\r\nHope for longer hours \r\nGreat ' staff-owners'  Had my husband grab takeout from here yesterday after driving by and searching for places to eat on the Internet, AMAZING! This place is only 8 months old so pretty new. Food was delicious, place was clean and the woman serving him was very nice. A lot of the food here seems to be homemade, from the homemade fish cakes we had (so good!) to the sauces and the rice noodles (from what I've read) and the portions were big enough to split one main for lunch for two people and keep you full till dinner. Lots of effort and attention put in for the food, the woman even described and explained the process of making some of the things we ordered. This was our first time here (and our first time having Burmese) and we will definitely be back. Prices were great and they have a great website with a menu and pictures and info which is key. They also have great lunch specials which we will try next time. Although I would love for this place to stay a secret, I want them to have more business and for other people to have the pleasure of eating here hah! Can't wait to go back!  What a wonderful find! The food was delicious and the service and care from the staff was wonderful. We were a party\r\n of four adults and three kids under seven. We wanted to try Burmese food and we will definitely be back to try the tea leaf salad.  Winter hours are different from summer hours. Call ahead on weekdays, they may be closed. They close at 7pm on weekends. The service was fast and friendly but the food was just alright. There could have been music or anything else but we ate in silence and we were the only table there. I was looking forward to eating here and was hoping that this would be a delicious hidden gem... Too bad. I probably won't come back or recommend this place after my experience. \r\n\r\nWe asked for recommendations and were directed to the specials. We picked 3 dishes including the curry and fish stew. Nothing really stood out but they were hot soupy dishes and it was cold and rainy out. \r\n\r\nVegetarians: you can substitute the meat broth for mushroom broth but they forgot to substitute mine and there were still chunks of chicken in my dish. My stomach was not feeling good considering I hadn't eaten meat in a decade. They also gave us complimentary soup but we later learned it was chicken broth based which they didn't tell us knowing I did not eat meat. The dish wasn't waived from the cost of the bill and they apologized and continued on.  Loves the food and you can really taste the effort that was put into making the dish. 5\\/5 hands down and would definitely revisit again with more friends :)  We love the food here!\r\n\r\nWe had the Green Papaya Salad which was crispy and very authentic-tasting. My advice is to get your own as sharing it is not enough. We also had the Noodle with Chicken, Fresh Veg and Coconut and it was very tasty too. Right amount of coconut and chicken taste and the noodle itself had a really good texture. You will know based on the taste that local people cooked the food. We also had the Burmese Style Beef Curry which was just average-tasting beef stew. \r\n\r\nThe servers who look like they own the place are very friendly too. \r\n\r\nWe will come back for sure to try the other noodle dishes!  Tried this place based on yelp reviews. Service was excellent! Tried the green tea salad was very good. Loaded with flavour and crunchy! Also tried the chicken noodle with coconut dish. Was tasty as well but not much chicken in it and pieces were small. The chicken was not the highlight but rather more like a garnish. The coconut sauce and noodles were the main focus of the dish. I would go back just to give the curry entrees a try as well.  I must be outright honest - the taste isn't to everyone's liking, but the food is quite good (objectively speaking). We ordered the fermented green tea salad, the mohinga (fish soup with rice noodles), and the spicy chicken curry.\r\n\r\nThe green tea salad came first, and it consists of lots of unidentified greens and tomatoes generously slathered in oil and filled with loads of sesame seeds and fried beans and peanuts. The taste is very distinct and special! The seeds and fried beans make the dish very fragrant.\r\n\r\nThe spicy chicken came next. My dad's main complaint was that the curry wasn't hot enough... Seemed like it was microwaved, but not quite enough. There were three portions of chicken, with some potatoes, and the curry came with white rice, salad, and soup. The soup had a very fragrant chicken oil flavour, and there were mashed potato bits at the bottom. I really enjoyed the soup! The waitress was very worried that we wouldn't be able to handle the spice and so urged us to order the medium spice level... However, we didn't find the medium spice to be spicy at all! \r\n\r\nThe fish soup came last. The rice noodles are all cooked to a mush, and the entire dish screams comfort. You're meant to eat it with a spoon, after adding some lime\\/lemon and roasted chili seeds to your liking. It was good, and the fried bits were definitely an interesting touch. I would've preferred more soup and less mush... Haha!  ***In the process of getting Debit.  So currently it's CASH ONLY!***\r\n\r\nService, Portions, Prices - 5\\/5 (female owner is very friendly, chatty, & enthusiastic!)\r\nFood itself - varied depending on what was ordered, see below\r\n\r\nRoyal Myanmar has tons going for it!  It offers an ethnic food that's not readily available (Burmese), a friendly owner who was eager to make suggestions about her food - I love that!, a diverse menu, & PARKING!!!  :)\r\n\r\nNow onto the food...\r\n\r\nGreen Tea Leaf Salad ($6.95) - Sorta like a garlicky slaw.  A texture-lover's delight, lotsa crunch!  My friend thought it was too salty, I thought it was ok.  There were peanuts, broadbeans, & peas, all crunchy.  Delicious roasted garlic taste! \r\n\r\nNoodle with Chicken, Fresh Veg, & Coconut ($7.95) - Really big portion!  It was like a warm noodle salad dressed in coconut milk, also lotsa texture.  Don't forget to squeeze some lime on top and mix well.  Could've used more lime (acid) to bring out more taste.  Feel free to ask the owner and I'm sure she'll oblige!\r\n\r\nBurmese Style Spicy Lime Chicken ($8.85) - Again, very generous portion.  Sauce was a red chilli-based gravy, a bit too salty and a tad too oily, was quite spicy!  I didn't taste any lime.  I think I would've enjoyed a curry more.\r\n\r\nI didn't care for either of the side soups or the stir fried veg that came with my Spicy Lime Chicken.  I don't feel as though they enhanced or contributed to the main meal.\r\n\r\nI'd definitely go back and try other items on the menu, most likely a Curry or a Noodle Soup.  Owner is very friendly and her personality will probably keep customers visiting again!  :)  Great place for Myanmar\\/Burmese food. The owners are very nice and the prices very reasonable. The food was great and there was a lot of food especially if you get soup. The staff were patient and willing to explain the food to us since we weren't familiar with Burmese food. \r\n\r\nSome of the previous reviews mentioned that there were specials but there weren't any when I went. \r\n\r\nI have made a side note to visit this place anytime I'm looking for a meal while driving the QEW. \r\n\r\nWiFi password is 02Burma17  I have been here 2 times so far and the food and service had been absolutely incredible. This place more than deserves the 5 star reviews it frequently gets. \r\nA small hole in the wall, family run business that is located seemingly in the middle of nowhere, where people make delicious and unexplainably unique recipes is how I would tend to describe this place. \r\nThe first time I went, I was in a bit of a hurry and got the S4 - Burmese style mixed salad and loved it so much I had to go back with my wife and our friends (I have friends???). \r\nMy only regret is that we never ate in. \r\nHere is the line up: \r\nWhile waiting for our take out order to be made, we got the A4 - Green tea leaf salad which is made with fermented tea leaves and served with tea. Get this, it is just so delicious. It's crispy, salty, spicy and has the most pleasant aroma. \r\nTo go:\r\nS4 Burmese style mixed salad\r\nN3 Noodle with chicken, fresh veg and coconut \r\nN4 Shan style noodles with chicken\r\nE3 Burmese style beef curry\r\n\r\nSo here's the kicker - each dish is served with a soup and Ommaar, the owner goes into detail about what soup to have with what dish. LISTEN TO HER, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!! \r\nThe food alone is amazing. The food with the paired soup brings about a brand new flavour. Don't believe me? Try the beef curry alone and then with the soup. \r\n\r\nMy wife and friends loved the food as well. We are absolutely going back. \r\n\r\nWe have yet to try the deserts.  When I lived in Scarborough years ago, we would frequent this restaurant near Cedarbrae Mall called Mandalay.  I would always order one of the Burmese curries because it was like nothing I've ever tasted before. When my neighbour told me about Royal Myanmar, I figured I must try it out rather than driving all the way to Scarborough.\r\n\r\nIt's located in a teensy plaza on Horner Ave.  For those of you who aren't from the hood, Horner isn't really filled with restaurants but rather a mix of industrial, low-rise apartments, residential, factories, you name it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I decided to order the Beef Curry, which was the special of the day. It came to $6.75 (taxes in - note: cash only).  The pic doesn't really do it justice because there was actually a lot of food in the container; I was only able to eat half the rice and 2\\/3 of the curry.  The curry itself was quite mildly spiced and not saucy like most curries I'm familiar with.  The meat was very tender - I could tell there was a lot of preparation that went into the dish.  What I really enjoyed was the peas soup; it was surprisingly light and very flavourful.  The best part of the dish was this dried chili condiment that was to be served on top of the curry.  It was salty, spicy, crunchy and had the right amount of heat.\r\n\r\nI would definitely return but I would try another dish next time.  Very friendly staff but slllooooww.\r\nI like getting in and out, felt like a lot of production to get take out.  I've always scrolled through the restaraunt options and this place always caught my eye. After deciding to try something new I stopped in. The service I received was fantastic. After the server asked us if it was our first time she gave us a number of recommendations that we tried. The green tea leaf salad was a unique starter that tasted fresh and delicious! I ordered the coconut noodle dish with chicken. It was also great! It also came with a soup which was pretty tasty. The server constantly made sure we were taken care of. I will be back for sure!  We tried this as a spur of the moment choice on our way out of Toronto. The Plaza was a bit off the highway, and looked a little run down but that tells me the restaurant will probably be very good. \r\n\r\nThe menu was short but descriptive, and prices were exceptional. We ordered the Coconut chicken and Spicy lime chicken entrees. \r\n\r\nFood was out quickly, and it was perfect. Portions were decent sized (the lime chicken was so good to me that it left me wanting more) and after dinner the owner came out to chat with us. She even sent out complimentary tea leaf salad, which was very interesting and delicious. \r\n\r\nWe'll definitely be back on our numerous trips between Buffalo and Toronto.  Finally found a proper Burmese restaurant in Toronto. The green tea salad was so good, must get each time. \r\nThe coconut soft and hard noodle dish was amazing. Very good flavor and texture. Have to go!  We'd never tried Burmese food before, but the food was delicious and the portions were huge. The meal included a soup, tea, rice, side salad & main dish which were very filling and the cost was low. We definitely didn't need the appetizer (tempura squash sticks), which we enjoyed too. We were imagining 5-6 pcs, but a massive plate came out. Everything was very flavorful. \r\n\r\nThe owner(s) were happy to engage with customers and recommended other dishes for future visits. They have a decent number of vegetarian options and we're very accommodating with food needs. They also checked in about common food allergies (nuts\\/fish). We had a nice chat about the different foods and an added bonus: some interesting shows about Burmese food, culture and travel playing on the screen.\r\nWe'll definitely be back.  I really like this spot. It has a little bit of everything when it comes to Asian cuisine. It's always very clean not that a restaurant should be anything other, buuuut we all had bad Asian restaurant experiences. \r\n\r\nMy favorite is the Tom yum soup, it taste just like I had in Thailand.\r\n\r\nSecond favorite is the coconut shrimp, take everything you know about coconut shrimp and put it out your mind. This dish is definitely different then average and is soooo good. \r\n\r\nThird is the crispy tofu cucumber salad. I can't explain it but it's good.\r\n\r\nFYI I order all three everytime lol  super delicious! all fresh.. i had never had coconut rice before and it was scrumptious :) big side salad with good greens for $4 too  This is a casual pacific east off shoot that has ample free parking!  They have a few soups, salads, rice bowls and apps.  I enjoyed the coconut curry chicken soup.  Resembled the malaysian soup Laksa in flavor but ingredients were simpler but broth maybe even more flavorful. The 9$ bowl is easily two servings.  If you ask they can replace the protein to tofu instead of chicken.  They chicken tomato soup was also flavorful but was more a clear broth with vermicelli compared to coconut thick broth and egg noodles for the coconut curry soup.  The restaurant is new so food preparation takes a little time but hopefully over the next weeks it will be able to adjust.  I want to try the salmon teriyaki time.  The location is conveniently located in cedar center near cedar warrensville intersection and they are some nice dessert places to visit after a savory meal.  Had teriyaki salmon and curry chicken with coconut rice from here on two separate occasions. Both were excellent! The cashier lady is super friendly and helpful as well!!! Overall it's well done!  Cat fish noodle soup doesn't have chunks of meat but catfish paste. $9 for an egg, noodles, and catfish paste broth...I gave 3 stars bc they let me get something else.  2\\/6\\/16*Just stopped in this new restaurant. My husband had the grilled whole red snapper with the beef tomato & basil rice w\\/mango smoothie and I had the grilled sliced beef with the coconut rice w\\/ pineapple smoothie. Both our meals were excellent! We will definitely frequent this place. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable about the food. Quick made to order cuisine. Worth every penny.  This a fantastic, slightly less crowded "branch off" spot by the Pacific East owners. The menu is simple, but consistently good and the portions are large (enough for two meals). The workers could not be nicer and were happy to point me towards some options when I was feeling indecisive. Compared to Pacific East, Pacific Grill has more of the Asian comfort food I grew up with, making it a go-to spot for quick Chinese!  Love the place!! Food is delicious and tasty. Unlike other fast food resturant's food the dishes here are very fresh and cooked upon ordering . Service is very friendly and ambiance is very good. Definitely worth a stop!!  Had a good first takeout experience from Pacific Grill! \r\n\r\nMy wife got the teriyaki salmon plate, which came with a generous portion of perfectly cooked salmon filet, served with white rice and a small salad. At $8.95, a great deal for fresh fish -- would definitely order again. I also randomly chose the "curry chicken rice with cashew and raisin," which reminded me of a Malaysian dish called Nasi Goreng (fried rice with a side of curry chicken). I really liked the chicken -- very tender, well spiced, and flavorful. The fried rice was tasty if a bit dry -- I wondered if it was cooked to order. \r\n\r\nWe also got the shichimi fries ($3.50) and the tea leaf salad. The fries are basically long potato wedges with a light Japanese pepper seasoning. Really nice! They could be crispier, but I\'d still probably order them again because I\'m a sucker for wedgies. I was really excited about the tea leaf salad because I haven\'t had Burmese food since leaving San Francisco. If you haven\'t had it, I recommend trying it -- a nice mix of textures and flavors. \r\n\r\nNot a big deal, but I did see a few other diners standing around and squinting at the menu with confused looks on their faces. Like its cousin Pacific East, Pacific Grill offers a funny mix of Southeast Asian (mainly Malaysian) and Japanese dishes -- two really dissimilar cuisines\\/cultures. But instead of putting them on different menus, Pacific Grill just lumps them all together, sometimes with awkwardly translated or barely descriptive names like "Yummy Yum Rice." I\'m guessing they may have to redo the menus after they get tired of answering questions.\r\n\r\nOverall, really happy to have this in the neighborhood! We\'ll be back for the reasonably authentic food and big portions -- looking forward to trying the katsu entrees.  Healthy options and good prices. Had the bulgogi, chicken katsu, and grilled salmon. Perfect for when you're tired and not in the mood to cook. Taste homemade.  I ordered the grilled seasoned veggies and tofu and it was really delicious. The customer service was really good and I look forward to coming back.  For people who like Burmese food, or if you've never had Burmese food before; this place is amazing. The food is fresh, and it tastes like a little piece of Burma. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for an authentic Asian meal (unlike Panda Express), you must come here! 5 out of 5!  So this is the only place in the great Cleveland (that I know of) that offers authentic Burmese dishes. There are many options on the menu so it may be a bit daunting when choosing your meal. For starters, I recommend the pea fritters, which remind me a bit of Indian samosas. The tea leaf salad has nice lemony dressing mixed with peanuts and pickled tea leaves. Sounds like an odd combination but it seriously goes well together. The tom yum soup is like no other I've had in Cleveland-just the right amount of kick and flavor. It paired perfectly with my grilled pork chop which was nicely seasoned and incredibly tender. Also I recommend the chicken and ginseng noodles which has nice clean broth containing peppery homemade meatballs. All in all, I would definitely come back!  The food is okay for the proces, but honestly, I mainly come here to get smoothies at 10pm lol. Dont judge me ;@p  Stopped in today for lunch to go. The guy behind the counter recommended the beef. I rarely order red meat but it seemed like a strong recommendation.  OMG - get the beef!!  Very spacious diner-like Asian fusion restaurant in a big plaza with other eateries like Five Guys, Panera, Chipotle, etc. Here, you order and pay first, then they'll bring you your food (all in disposable paperware). \r\n\r\nThere's a variety of dishes, including rice entrees and noodle options. We tried the katsu ramen and saut\xc3\xa9ed sliced beef with onions. Ramen noodles were too soft, but the portion size was decent (it came with quite a few pieces of meat). The soup and flavoring were kind of bland and didn't taste like much. The saut\xc3\xa9ed beef with onion is a rice dish, which also came with a side of salad. This one was pretty good. The beef and onions were well cooked and sweet. The portion size here was also pretty large as we took home half the beef with rice. Came a second time and tried the grilled pork chop (pretty good too!) and the fragrant chicken & tomato soup with noodles. I still prefer their rice dishes to their noodle dishes, but the tomato one was definitely better than the ramen.\r\n\r\nBoba milk tea drinks were so-so. Definitely doesn't compare to the ones we have in CA for the price of $3.75 each, but the taro flavor was pretty on point. Thai tea flavor was not so great. Another complaint is that the drink was like 1\\/3 ice (even though I asked for less ice) so it was difficult to get to all the boba. \r\n\r\nBig plaza, lots of parking. But also lots of other choices. Not a bad place if you're craving Asian food, and seems like lots of people come by for takeout.  Really Really good value for what you are getting.  My wife got the beef noodle soup and I got the Makarel, which were both very good and well priced compared to other local places.  I also got a green tea boba which was good, although I think the boba were softer than is standard.  Overall, great option for price effective asian food without driving too far from the east side.\r\n-KD  I... didn't really know what to make of this place, but I think I have gotten it figured out.  When you first walk in and take a look at the menu, it looks like they have a strange mishmash of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malay and Thai rice and noodle bowls.  However, this restaurant, like its sister restaurant Pacific East, is owned by Chinese people.  So, this restaurant basically serves a mishmash of Asian rice bowls with a Chinese twist.\r\n\r\nImagine Japanese ramen, Japanese katsu, Korean ginger chicken, but cooked in a Chinese style by Chinese people.  They were good, but just not exactly what we were expecting.  Incredibly impressed with the food here! This is the perfect place if you are looking for a fast casual meal that provides the comfort and satisfaction of a home-cooked dinner based on a traditional Asian foundation of rice or noodles, but without the unnecessary flair of fancy serving dishes. If you are looking for a restaurant where the waiter constantly makes pleasant conversation with your party, asks you how the food tastes, and asks if you need anything else, this is not that kind of place. You'll most likely receive your food in a recyclable to-go box (yay for sustainability!) unless it's a hot noodle soup, then you'll probably get a more sturdy bowl. This place is as straightforward as a food destination can be. You enter, look at the menu, order your food, pay, eat, enjoy the food (highly recommend to bring friends\\/family and share the plethora of choices in the menu), and then clean up and leave. I'm a practical person, so this suits my style of dinner. In terms of food quality, I'm a huge fan of how large the meat portions are for each dish that I've tried thus far (grilled beef, eel, katsu chicken). Each dish comes as a combo, so you get your balance of all the food groups - carbs (rice\\/noodle), protein, and veggies (salad with dressing). I Highly recommend this place for its pragmatic approach to food, and I look forward to returning here on a weekly basis and bringing more friends each time!  Not typical "Chinese food" but a diverse menu of Japanese, Malaysian and Burmese dishes. Food is made to order, tastes scrumptious! I recommend!!!!  Came here for sit down dinner with my boyfriend during a weekday night. Outside of a couple at a different table & some to go orders, the place was pretty empty. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend ordered their Katsu ramen. I ordered the chicken katsu. Both of ordered green tea milk tea & the shichimi fries. \r\n\r\nKatsu ramen: \r\n-came out in soggy KFC style bucket\r\n-some of the noodles were undercooked and according to my boyfriend "harder than copper wire" and some were over cooked and very mushy\r\n-there was an over cooked hard boiled egg in there (most ramen places do soft boiled, but seeing that this isn\'t an authentic Japanese restaurant, it\'s not expected...but...)\r\n-the egg was so "hard boiled" the yolk part spun out of it like it was its own separate entity\r\n-the bamboo shoots were also overly tough\r\n-there was one piece of meat in the entire bowl\r\n-90% of the bowl was vegetables\r\n\r\nChicken katsu: \r\n-instead of being given the typical sweet Katsu sauce, i got a small container of very thick peanut sauce (it was ok)\r\n-the katsu was very dry and bland without slathering it in sauce\r\n-the bright side was they give 2 very large pieces of katsu\r\n\r\nShichimi fries: \r\n-very long thick potato fries that are the length of a person\'s hand\r\n-they were covered in batter and fried shortly. Despite being seasoned with furikake, it only tasted of dough\r\n\r\nGreen tea milk tea: \r\n-boyfriend\'s tea: the boba was undercooked and still hard\r\n-my tea: the boba was over cooked and barely held a physical form. literally melted in your mouth. gross. \r\n-the overall tea just tasted like they added a pinch of artificial powder into some hot water with a tsp of milk\r\n\r\nThe entire order was around $30. Definitely not worth it for that price.  Five stars for the E12 sauteed beef with unions. Haven't really tried much else other than the spicy beef soup. That was good too.  This is probably one of my favorite places close to my home. Their quality and freshness is great and service is really good everyone is extremely friendly and informative. I come here quite often and refer a ton of my friends. Everything is very authentic from their soups to chicken which is awesome and I love the coconut shrimp okay I'm rambling now but you get my point this place is great!  Called in for pick up. Got the wasabi fish & chips and grilled pork chop dinners....good food and a great value for the \xc3\xa7ost....both dinners came with steamed rice, salad, and French fries....so much food. I could only eat half. I was pleasantly surprised and will be back. The staff was nice and friendly too!  Healthy, good quality, delicious Japanese food at an affordable price. Love that it's not greasy and that they accommodate my detailed requests. Their build-your-own-soups are AMAZING! Highly recommended!  This is a must try! I eat here about once a week and always get the pulled chicken rice bowl. I consider this my comfort food because it's warm and easy on the stomach. All of my roommates get the pulled chicken as well. We tried the fried fish and chips and my friend claimed it may have been the best fish and chips he's ever had. The Wasabi dip was spot on.  Wow, such variety and yumminess leaves me wanting more! I ordered salmon, and boy was it good! They serve the food in plates with different sections so that food doesn't mix in with the other food. Everything here is extremely fresh. The bubble tea is a guilty pleasure but came with no ice. Over all it is worth coming back.  My new favorite restaurant. I dine at Pacific East at least twice a month. I was so excited to see this  takeout\\/spin off of Pacific East (if that makes sense lol). However, once I looked at the menu I was scared. The lady who worked was really nice and helped me pick something simple. I ordered a teriyaki salmon and the pulled chicken. Lots of food per order with plenty of leftovers. I subbed my salad for grilled veggies and they were amazing.\r\n\r\nMy family didn't like it much but I think the best thing is to mix and match things. I took the coconut rice that came with my pulled chicken, put my teriyaki salmon and grilled on top and topped it with their house made yum yum sauce once I got home. I'll be a regular here!  Our family have been here many times. Every time we are satisfied. The owner is vey nice. We enjoy the noodles and fish.  I Love Pacific East Coventry.  Was so excited to see this quick casual version open even closer to my home. I only tried a soup, Chicken Ginseng, so far but it was great.  Looking forward to coming back and trying more, especially the whole grilled Snapper.  I love the food here! I have tried everything from the noodle dishes to the soup. My favorite is the curry chicken,  delicious. I'm also a fan of the chicken coconut soup and the coconut rice.  The ginger salad dressing is also scrumptious! Tge pacer is always immaculate and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating.  We are huge fans of Pacific East (both locations), this was my first time at Pacific Grill, and definitely not my last!  I went here on a Friday evening, there was a steady stream of customers.  I ordered the Shitake Mushroom soup, which is the soup that I LOVE at Pacific East.  I also ordered the grilled pork combo w\\/brown rice.  There was a bit of a wait, but the food arrived hot, fresh and delicious.  The soup was fairly similar to what I order at Pacific East, except the portion was more generous and there were more charred onions and mushrooms, which made it even more tasty.  The only thing missing was the lemon wedge.  The entr\xc3\xa9e included simple salad with ginger dressing.  The brown rice was $1.00 upcharge, but totally worth it.  The rice was wide grain with quinoa mixed in, and the portion was more than generous.  Last but not least, the pork was grilled perfectly, seasoned nicely and the portion was huge.   All in all, this was a great meal.  I can't wait to return to try some of the other menu offerings.  Wanted a change of pace last night for diner and saw this place on yelp. The marinated steak was great. I'll be going back for the interesting menu. Staff was very personable.  Save yourself the time and money.  Slow service.  Sad decor. And undercooked, under seasoned fare that comes in over sized paper cups with teeny little spoons and chopsticks. The worst part: "Katsu ramen" pictured as dry noodles and meat that came as dishwater flavor soup and the insistence (twice) that I got what I ordered. And wasabi fish that has never even been near wasabi. Sad. Just sad.  Second time dining here. The middle soup is great. I ordered mixed grill. All cooked to perfection except shrimp is overcooked. The spicy tofu salad is too spicy. Fast like sambal olek hot sauce mixed with sweet chili sauce. I will ask for sauce on side next time. Just too much sauce for salad. Shrimp summer roll is very fresh. Just an overall comfort food for me.  Update: came back, had their Katsu ramen.  Yum and a good value.  Deep bone broth flavor.  Sun ramen I think.  Spicy crispy tofu.  Awesome.  Pulled chicken and rice had good rice but chicken was a bit dry.  Upgrading my review.  This place should be busier!\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSo I'm a pretty big fan of Pacific East on Coventry.  Great Malaysian food and pretty good sushi.  So when I heard about this place, opened by the same owners, I decided to truck out from the south side to take a look.  \r\n\r\nThis place is a fast casual place- you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  There is a large tv playing food travel videos which I thought was a nice touch.  Prices are pretty good and the place was surprisingly empty.  \r\n\r\nWe got a number of things:\r\n\r\nTakoyaki- those tasty Japanese octopus balls.  These were good, and a reasonable price\r\n\r\nSamusa- like a samosa.  Smaller than I expected but tasty\r\n\r\nShrimp summer roll - tasty, fresh.  Better than average\r\n\r\nSpicy Tom yum soup - authentic, deep flavored broth.  Only one shrimp but it was a bigger one.  Would be nice to have some noodles in it. \r\n\r\nFish chowder - meh, didn't like it.  Should have gotten something else. \r\n\r\nCurry chicken - excellent.  Really delicious.  Probably would have even better with coconut rice. \r\n\r\nRoasted Red Snapper - not cheap but very well cooked and delicious.  Would have been even better if The Kid did not claim the lemon that was meant to squirt on it. \r\n\r\nCold chicken peanut seasame noodles - tasted heavy and were warm not cold.  I liked it ok, The Wife didn't. \r\n\r\nBeef noodle soup - it was good, not as good as The Wife's but, not bad for Cleveland.  Phusion Cafe does it better when they are on their game. \r\n\r\nOverall I did like this place- there were some things that fell flat.  Buuuuut I wish they would open one closer to Fairlawn so southsiders could get a taste more easily.  Very disappointed, I have read some of the reviews and was so excited to try this place out. We ordered our food ahead of time and upon picking it up 30mins after ordering it still wasn't ready. On top of that I was given someone else's food in which we ended up swapping when realizing it. Initially when I opened the container everything looked great but then under three huge veggies were veggies swimming in a pool full of oil. It was unbearable to eat! The tofu was hard, and tasteless. I am very disappointed from the outcome of the meal. Luckily my job had ordered food and was able to feed me a lunch instead of having me eat oil for lunch. This place might look healthy but I can guarantee you those practices of soaking food in oil is not healthy.  Great food and service! Casual dining. My favorite is the spices beef noodle soup. You get a huge bowl.  This is a recently opened restaurant started by the owners of Pacific East. However, the menu is significantly different, and Pacific Grill serves a lot of Burmese food in addition to Japanese and Malaysian. I had the Fish Chowder Noodles, the Beef Tomato Basil Rice, and the Curry Chicken. The owner made it clear that the curry chicken was not Japanese or Chinese, but Burmese style. The curry chicken was very good, and was served with some delicious basmati rice. We also got some free samples of the fried split pea and one of their salads - both were also very good. Pacific Grill also sells bubble tea, but I didn't try their bubble tea this time. I really like Pacific Grill because good Burmese food is very hard to find. I plan on bringing one of my Burmese friends in the future to try it, to see what her thoughts are. I also plan on bringing some of my other food loving friends here because it's definitely a very unique culinary experience that you can't find elsewhere in northeast Ohio.  First time. \r\n\r\nWasn't impressed. Had the salmon. Didn't finish it. Had no flavor even with the teriyaki sauce. \r\n\r\nWill I return: prob not.  So I came back... this time I brought the whole family with me. Last time, I tried the Katsu Ramen (soup), which I enjoyed. This time I wanted to try some of their rice dishes and other entrees, so we ordered:\r\n\r\nFor the kids - the Chicken Katsu entree (E-11). It came with a salad, rice and slices of chicken breast fillet, breaded and fried, with katsu sauce for dipping. A very simple meal that I think just about anyone could enjoy. \r\n\r\nHome made pulled chicken and rice (R-3). For the kids again... it came in a big bowl, flavored rice topped with lots of shredded chicken. Quick, easy and good!\r\n\r\nGrilled sliced beef entree (E-2). Came with a salad, rice and slices of grilled beef over a bed of lettuce. Very tender and flavorful. Like the Chicken katsu, another very simple meal that can be enjoyed by just about anyone. I also had a bowl of their spicy tom yum soup (C-2), a soup that I\'m a huge fan of. I liked theirs, but it\'s just not prepared the way I\'m used to. I\'m used to the broth being more clear-ish and with lots of mushrooms and shrimp... theirs was cloudy with no mushrooms and little shrimp. Still not bad, but not sure I\'d get it again.\r\n\r\nChicken & Coconut gravy noodles (N-2). Came in a big bowl, big portion. My wife had this. She said it was just "okay". Didn\'t really find a whole lot of flavor, not much chicken, and the noodles seemed like your regular egg noodles you\'d get from any standard grocery store.\r\n\r\nFinally, my parents got the Grilled seafood mix (E-9). It came with salad, rice, salmon, shrimp and an oyster. I tried some of it... and I\'ve decided I know what I\'m getting next time. This dish was da bomb! Shrimp perfectly seasoned and grilled - not overcooked!\r\n\r\nThe minor issue we all had with this visit was that our rice seemed a bit old - maybe had been sitting there all day. Parts of it were hard. \r\n\r\nALSO... on my first visit, and on their menu the rice bowls came with a salad, and the noodle bowls came with a side of onion rings or shredded taro or split pea fritters. On this visit, they no longer offered them and crossed them off their menus. Not sure what happened here.\r\n\r\nOverall, a very good visit to discover many items on their menu. I think we\'ll be regulars here...  I'm on a diet and I am conscious of what im eating. Pacific Grill had perfect sized healthy spring rolls that came with peanut sauce for only $2! It was very fresh and just enough to fill me up. The restaurant is really nice inside. Very spacious with lots of tables. I like that they have pictures  of all the food items they serve right on the wall. I would like to try another dish the next time im in the area.  Fish chowder is one of the best. Made of real fish not msg. Ramen noodle salad is my second favorite. Probably the only place in Cleveland for real Burmese food and authentic Asian cuisine.  This place is great. Their cold sesame noodles are fresh and exactly what they should be, the perfect hint of spice, the best taste and fresh cucumber and peanuts and egg on top.  \r\n\r\nThe staff is helpful and friendly... My only minor criticism is that they charged the same price for the dish without chicken; However, to be fair, I didn't argue because the staff was so nice!  My colleagues and I come in here about once a week. I can't believe it's never busy when we go. I hope dinner time they get a rush because lunch is usually quiet. Once a week we had been coming for the Chicken Katsu, but they recently changed their menu offering more options. The Chicken Katsu is still on the menu, but they offer some Ramen and Soup that is very good! This is not a fancy dining experience. You walk up to the counter to pay and get a drink and they bring the food to your table. It's not fancy, but it isn't very cheap either. With a drink you are looking at around $12 - $13 per person, but the portion sizes are big. If you aren't a big eater this may get you a meal and a snack.  I decided to give this place a try. I passed it multiple times in the plaza and I wasn't disappointed. I got the coconut shrimp and I can  see myself craving it all the time...nice size and crispy!!  I've been patiently waiting for Pacific Grill to open. I'm a huge fan of Pacific East and live within walking distance of Cedar Center. This new concept is unlike other fast casual Asian places I've seen. Outside of Katsu Ramen, all the dishes are new to me. It would be helpful to have descriptions available as the staff is still getting familiar with the ingredients. The pictures on the TV inside are helpful, but not every item is represented. \r\n\r\nI had the Homemade Pulled Chicken Rice and even though it was basically rice and chicken, the portion was huge (it comes in a 64oz to-go tub) and very flavorful. However, the person taking my order gave me the impression that there would be veggies in it and that wasn't true. I think that would have made it an even better dish. Still, I took half home and it made a tasty lunch the next day.\r\n\r\nMy boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Ginseng Broth Noodles and the broth I tasted was very flavorful. Not exactly on par with Superior Pho's broth, but very tasty. I would order it for myself.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good addition to the area and there are quite a few items I look forward to trying.  The owners of the renowned Pacific East sushi restaurant (Coventry Rd) have done it again. Like Pacific East, Pacific Grill has a diverse and interesting menu, excellent flavors, and top-notch ingredients, all at a reasonable price. If you're disenchanted with typical American-Asian fare (such as Chinese carry-out) or simply in the mood for Japanese and Thai-style food, definitely give this a try.\r\n\r\nDon't just think of this as carry-out, however. The interior is well-decorated and spacious, not to mention very quiet. I have yet to see more than a few people eating in the venue itself.  Service is quickand friendly. I only waited 10 minutes in the store for 2 full dishes. I tried the Tokyo roll and one of their most popular noodle dishes called Myanmar something. Both tasted great and the serving sizes were pretty large large. The only complaint I have is with the prices... A tad high. I spent $20 on the two dishes overall. I recommend the place, and I'm going to try their other dishes soon.  Great little local business that serves a variety of different southeast Asian samples, in addition to sushi. I've been here several times and ordered some of the dry noodle dishes (Fried Flat Noodle, Fried Rice Noodle, Fried Yellow Noodle) as well as the mint and basil rice dishes. They are all delightful in their own way, full of flavor and not overly greasy like the mainstream Asian American food one might find at the likes of OE or Golden Palace. A friend also tried some of their noodle soups, and the Shan Tribe Noodle is definitely one to recommend. \r\n\r\nI've noticed that the rice dishes are somewhat smaller than the noodles, so go for the latter if you are hungry. I would say that the rice dishes, other than the herbs, aren't too much different from what other AA joints would make. Not too sure about the sushi either, but regardless of what you order the prices are quite affordable!\r\n\r\nAs for ambiance, there never seem to be more than 2 or 3 tables full at a time--a perfect setting for getting away from the rowdiness of Oakland. The owners of this place are also extremely friendly and attentive, and always provide you with sufficient utensils, napkins, and water refills. The calm atmosphere also ensures that the wait time for your food is never more than 10 minutes, so that's another plus if you're rushed for time.  I was excited to try Burma-Tokyo because I love finding little hole-in-the-wall places with interesting, authentic-tasting food.  However, I was disappointed by my dinner. We ordered a vegetable tempura appetizer, which was ok. I mean, tempura is tempura, it was hot and greasy (a good thing for tempura!) but some of the vegetables inside the batter were just unidentifiable. I had one piece with sweet potato (yum) and then another with some white thing inside that didn\'t have much flavor. So it was a little hit-and-miss.\r\nI ordered the dish called "Nepal" with was a piece of roti, veggie samosas,  and tomato-based soup with potatoes and chicken. The roti was tasty, though greasy, and the samosas were not the best I\'ve ever had. They were okay, but could have been more flavorful. The soup was my least favorite part of the dish-- it was very salty. \r\nTo the restaurant\'s credit, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing... my boyfriend ordered a fried rice dish that he loved, and devoured the whole thing. The service was quick and friendly, but I was not all that impressed by the food. Next time I am having a craving for Asian food, I think I will try somewhere else.  the Shan tribe noodle dish is great, lots of chili and garlic, pretty spicy I loved it. Owners are from this ethnic group in Myanmar (what the British decided to call Burma in the colonialism period) so this is their native food. The menu is very diverse with dishes from various Asian nations. Low prices, very friendly people. The Burmese vegetable soup is a good choice also!!  I don't understand the positive reviews.  My experience with the sushi and the tom yum soup was terrifying.  The fish didn't even seem real.  It was a flavorless, possibly dyed-to-look-like-salmon block of garbagefish.  NOT salmon.  It was the same as the NOT TUNA.  The rice was a ball of tasteless gelatin.  It was a thick ball of pasty nothing.  I could have had a better experience with supermarket sushi.  The soup tasted like every tin can each ingredient came out of, and the two pieces of chicken in it were hard and flavorless.  Who is giving all of these positive reviews?  We chose to check this place out because we had a spend $50 get $25 off coupon from restaurants.com.  Well, the inside of this place is kind of low rent and all of the glasses and plates were plastic.  It felt more like eating at a cafeteria than at a restaurant.\r\n\r\nWe were looking forward to sashimi, and we each got a Tom Yum soup (pretty good, 3\\/5), seaweed salad (3\\/5), and 2 orders of sushi\\/sashimi (2\\/5).  We were also told to order more food, because we were $6 short... then told to get more because we needed $1 more to reach $50 for the coupon.\r\n\r\nOverall it was disappointing, and the sushi\\/sashimi tasted like it had been frozen, or maybe it was just on ice for too long.\r\n\r\nThe service was good, and the owners were very friendly.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the road meal would have been ok, had our total not come to $41.50 for both of us... after the $25 coupon.  To make things worse, we split the bill on two credit cards and they rounded up our food cost to $21 per card.  Not a big deal, but still another little thing that further discourages us from returning here.\r\n\r\nIf you want sushi, I suggest going to the excellent Chaya in Squirrel Hill.  One of the worst dinners out I\'ve had in a long time. And a surprise, because of the great review in Pittsburgh\'s City Paper and the raves from other Yelp diners.\r\nStart with the appearance of the place, a grim storefront, tables so close together that I could hear customers to our left discussing the diarrhea they had contracted on their trip to Mexico, all with harsh overhead lighting.\r\nWe ordered samosas from the appetizer menu, a Burmese noodle dish for my husband, and an Indian chicken and rice dish for myself. My husband\'s noodles were served at least 30 minutes before anything else, and had clearly been microwaved; they had that uneven hot spots thing you get with microwaving and weren\'t hot enough, IMO a cardinal sin for hot food-it should be served HOT. Finally the samosas came out, tasty but oozing grease. We waited so long after that that we actually asked for our check when they finally served the rice and chicken. A plate of dry, broken, crunchy rice that had the texture of the rice you scrape from the bottom of the pot was topped with a huge, clearly microwaved, leg-thigh section of chicken. This rice was described on the menu as "basmati" and to my mind basmati rice is beautiful long-grained rice. This rice did not meet that description and was barely edible. The chicken was tough.\r\nWhen we left we made tracks to a frozen yogurt place for some serious palate-cleansing.  Initially when I walked in, I was definitely taken back by the dive decor, and actually had doubts about staying there for dinner. The hostess\\/waiter was extremely pleasant and the dishes on the menu were incredibly cheap. My bf and I ordered the samosa and vegetarian dumplings which were both deep fried and were quite delicious. \r\n\r\nI ordered the Korean rice dish with chicken. It was the perfect blend of spices and full of flavor. My bf ordered the Myanmar noodles with tofu and the spices were very distinct and original but blended together perfectly. All in all, we would definitely go back there for dinner. It's a nice dive dinner joint with great food.  Burma-Tokyo is a hidden gem on Atwood in Oakland, a gourmet ethnic treasure crouched stealthily like a hidden speak easy, between littered college housing and dingy convenience stores.  Despite it\'s odd location, it\'s convenient to get to, absolutely delicious, incredibly inexpensive and never crowded.  They are available through "Wheel Deliver" if you want delivery, and while their appetizers are priced fairly normally at $5 for a few small tasty bites, the entrees are mostly $8 for a MASSIVE homemade dish of authentic Burmese heaven.\r\n\r\nIf you haven\'t had Burmese food, imagine you combined plates from your favorite Thai and Japanese restaurants.  The service is very friendly and helpful, they definitely take pride in their offerings.  The atmosphere isn\'t fancy, but I can\'t fault them for unpretentiously putting their focus on the food!  For those in the know, these are some of the best deals on the best dishes in Oakland!  This is within walking distance of Magee Women's Hospital, so I decided to take a chance and try. I was hopeful upon walking in, since the restaurant is dingy and dirty like many good Asian restaurants, but I was pretty disappointed by the end of the meal. The samosas are made with phyllo dough, and they tasted okay. I'm from Malaysia, so I decided to try the Malaysian style fried rice, and I have no idea what style from Malaysia they're claiming. I can't even describe in words how far off-base the fried rice was from what you really get in Malaysia. I realize the exact ingredients and flavors may not be the same as overseas, but whatever I ate wasn't even close. I have been to other Asian restaurants who have been able to produce a dish close enough.\r\n\r\nThe service is okay, although beware that the aunt who is your waitress doesn't speak English very well. Her nephew, who seemed to run the business (since he handled the money), came over to apologize about her poor English. He then proceeded to have a conversation with me, but I couldn't hear or understand him very well. I'm usually pretty good with Asian-accented English, but I was at a loss. \r\n\r\nAmerican Express is not accepted here (primary credit card company for corporations), so I probably won't return.  I came to BTR on my hour break from work to get some take out, only one table had been seated so I thought this was going to be a quick trip. \r\n\r\nA very sweet older woman came over with a menu and explained some of the dishes to me. I informed her I was a vegetarian and had it narrowed down to 2 choices, the Kaung Pond Kyaw or Akitashi tofu. She told me many of the dishes can be made vegetarian so I wasn\'t limited to just the veggie section of the menu. Well, this opened up countless possibilities for me. My eyes narrowed in on the Cambodia dish which is made with coconut cream, veggies and tofu instead of chicken for $6.99. \r\n\r\nNext she asked my spice level preference and I told her a 10 "Oh! You like it spicy." she remarked. Yes, I like it spicy and I\'ve ordered too many 8\'s that tasted like 2\'s so I have a habit of overstating my preferences now. My order took longer than I had expected but I knew everything would be fresh so it was no big deal. About 20 minutes after ordering, the woman came up to me and very apologetically informed me that my order was made with chicken so it had to be redone from scratch. I was a little upset only because I had a limited amount of time, but I was grateful she came out and explained the situation. \r\n\r\nI had only 10 minutes to enjoy my dinner by the time I got back to work, but enjoy it I did! Lots of fresh, tender veggies and lightly fried tofu were bathed in a spicy (A 10 means a 10 here!) coconut sauce. I\'m sure I\'ll return, but I\'ll call my order in first.  We got the Tokyo Roll, tom-yum soup, Cambodia (chicken), Shan tribe noodle soup, vegetable tempura, and the lime juice. Sooooo delicious and would definitely go back. \r\n\r\nWe ordered 7-8 in spiciness for the chicken and the noodle soup. While 7 was perfect for the chicken, 8 for the soup was seriously spicy.  The lime juice was a delicious balance against the spiciness though.  I was actually surprised at how good the sushi and the tempura were for a fusion restaurant.  The sushi tasted fresh and the tempura was crispy, as it should be. \r\n\r\nThe owners are also super nice and apparently they make the noodles themselves. Impressive.  Cozy little restaurant with an interesting combination of Burmese and Japanese fare. As for Burmese fare, I am a huge fan and am glad that one can find this cuisine in Pittsburgh. The prices are reasonable and it's nice to try something new.  This small restaurant is near India Garden. It looks so unassuming that I mistook it for one of  the long-time ne'er-do-well eateries on Atwood. This place apparently has been in business for about 6 months already, but it desperately needs to advertise itself. I only found it because I chanced upon Anna Z's Yelp review. I went during lunch time, but I was the only person in the dining room -- this is too bad, because their food is really good!\r\n\r\nAs the name of the restaurant suggests, it is a Burmese place that also happens to serve sushi.  As far as I can tell, the sushi is decent enough (I had two pieces of hand rolls -- they were fine), but the stars of the menu are the Burmese dishes. I ordered the soup bowl  (#13 on the menu) with rice vermicelli, leafy greens, meat balls, fish balls and a soft-boiled egg and two quail eggs.  It came piping hot and full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat\\/fish balls). The broth also has a rich flavor. A big bowl of hot soupy noodles definitely hits the spot on a cold winter day. \r\n\r\nSummary: This is by far the best Southeast Asian offering in Oakland (arguably within a 200 mile radius). It may become my new favorite lunch place.  Surprisingly good food for such an oddly uninviting storefront. Pick up order was ready within 10 minutes of my phone call, which involves silly levels of efficiency. Squid salad wasn't so spicy, but was really good. Sliced ginger was a little strong, but squid was actually tender.\r\n\r\nLaos spearmint came with cubed chicken, zucchini, carrots, broccoli, standard veggies. Not a very strongly flavored dish, I didn't think I'd ever use the word subtle for a takeout place, but it's appropriate. \r\n\r\nAvocado shake was like any other avocado shake, except for a few ice chunks that hadn't been blended in all the way. Really good for Pittsburgh, extra points for being 2 blocks away and cheapish.  This place is delicious and cheap. The soup is amazing. I eat here once a week and the employees\\/owners are friendly. The food is incredibly great! I look forward to dinner at Burma Tokyo every week. The food is flavorful and really great. Other reviews state that this is a great hole in the wall and I completely agree!  This place was magnificent.  They could really use a little spic and span but the food was great. I took the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers and went with Kyawe soup although think it was called something different on the menu. The soup is one of Burmese popular soup, made with chicken broth, shrimp ball, fish ball, egg, quill egg, mustard leaf, chicken meat ball, pork ball and rice noodle. The menu boasts that all balls are Burmese's homemade style.  I have never had any Burmese style balls I tried to do some independent study on shrimp balls on line in preparation for this meal but even that wasn't enough to prepare me for the heavenly goodness. The soup at first glance looked simple since the broth was clear but the flavors were so charming and likable. \r\n I thought that I might not enjoy this soup since I am not a fan of pho but this was nothing like pho and commanded its own respect. With each bite I keep telling myself this is going to suck and I am not going to enjoy it I am about to put something in my mouth that is going to be funky I was so wrong.  \r\nI was surprised that I was the only one dining here at 12:00pm on a Thursday. Burma-Tokyo is off the beaten path though but very near Spice Island Tea House.  Home style cooking with fabulous service. Healthy in terms of veggies, but may disappoint meat lovers.  I'm new to the city and this was a great find. The service for my take out order was fantastic, and I got my food with little wait. I ordered the Rice Noodle dish with chicken and vegetables, and I have to say it's the best version of this dish I've ever had. I will definitely come back to try other dishes and the sushi. Excellent!  We started ordering food through wheel deliver from Burma Tokyo, and it's great. B loves the sushi and the prices, and my favorites are the Tom yum soup and fried rice. Plus wheel deliver brings it to our door...can't beat it!  A family owned, whole in the wall with some of the best tasting, and inexpensive meals.  The owner makes great recommendations, and let us sample new menu items.  They are pretty fast for lunch and dinner.  I have gone in groups with 4-6 coworkers, and we can be in and out within 45 minutes.  they are very accommodating and allow you to order ahead if you are on a time crunch.   They can alter almost every menu item to be vegetarian or vegan, and the majority of the food is pretty healthy.   .  Love this place. We were in Pittsburgh for X-mas and I called this place up to see if they were open for dinner. They were closing but they agreed to keep it open for a few mins for us to dine in. I went with the recommendation of the owner and got burmese vegetarian soup. My BF ordered Tom Yum soup. Mine looked clear and seemed like it did not have any flavor at all, but once spoon proved it all wrong. It was delicious! I really would give them 5 stars if they had the right atmosphere\\/decor! Food is delicious, home made. \r\n\r\nSeems like they've converted their house into a restaurant but no complains because the food is great! Great service, i would definitely be back if I get a chance to get back to the area. Check it out!  We stumbled upon this place completely by chance, as we were wandering the streets of Oakland, looking for a sit-down restaurant we hadn't tried before.\r\n\r\nBurma-Tokyo boasts a menu that spans a lot of different types of cuisine.  They have a full sushi menu (which we didn't try on our visit), and also a series other Asian specialty dishes cooked 'in the Burmese style'.  I had the Nepal platter, which was a stew-like dish of chicken, mushroom, and potatoes, served with roti bread and samosas.  My husband got the Laos peppermint leaf with pork, which was had real peppermint leaves, and not just the flavoring.  Such unique flavors, we both really enjoyed our dishes (and sampling bites from each other's).\r\n\r\nI ordered some green tea, which was served in a gigantic Coca-Cola glass, enough for us to share.  And the miso soup was also huge and perfectly salty.\r\n\r\nThe prices were great - for two entrees, tea, soup, and an appetizer, our total was less than $25.  And the service was great.  Our waiter could answer any questions we had about the menu or spices.  We will definitely be back!\r\n\r\n(Parking is on the street, so be aware that during the school year, that could be a little tricky.  But, if you can't find a spot to park, you can order delivery from Burma-Tokyo through campusfood.com, so there's no excuse not to try it!  :)  Not sure how I missed this place for so long - stumbled across it trying to find the name of another place in Oakland, and I'm very happy I did.  Stopped in for lunch on a snowy Saturday on a sightseeing jaunt to Oakland.\r\n\r\nI've travelled around a good chunk of the rest of SE Asia, so I was curious about Burmese food.  I had the kyawe noodle bowl - sort of a pho-style dish with rice noodles and a nice little assortment of proteins: fish balls, shrimp balls, egg, quail egg, etc.  Very good.  My partner had the tom yum, and it was excellent.  The Burmese iced tea was good, too - pretty similar to Thai iced tea, which they also serve.  (I think the Burmese was made with a green tea, but I'm not certain.)  It was all very good, more so given the prices: $7 per plate (bowl).\r\n\r\nDecor was nice (that lots-of-lacquered-wood sushi-place look), especially given the neighborhood and prices, and the waiter was extremely friendly.  Highly recommend this place, especially if you're a fan of the SE Asian cuisines.  Biggest downside: parking.  Oakland's not the easiest place to find a spot.  I came here at about 8:00 PM on a Saturday, and (to my surprise) the restaurant was completely empty. The menu is basically split up into appetizers, specialties (from various parts of east Asia), and sushi. The sushi combos were an intriguing deal, but I bypassed ordering raw fish because of the emptiness of the restaurant.\r\n\r\nI decided on the Myanmar specialty (Shan Tribe Noodle). I saw the ingredients chili paste and cilantro, so there was no way I could pass up on the dish. While waiting I was served a complimentary glass of tea which was a nice gesture.\r\n\r\nOnce served the noodle soup was delicious. It had a great contrast of flavors and textures. In regard to the former, the 'hot spices' were balanced with the 'aromatic spices.' In regard to the latter, the textures ranged from soft noodles and beans, to slightly crunchy but soft carrots, to the crunchy grounded peanuts. Overall, a very enjoyable dish.\r\n\r\nThe service was very attentive (though I was the only customer).\r\n\r\nNote, the prices listed on the Yelp menu seem to be less than the current prices at the restaurant (as of 4\\/20\\/2013); for example, the Myanmar specialty dish is listed at $7.19 online but $8.99 at the restaurant.  Noodles are excellent. We've had few items on the noodle section of the menu plus the specialty foods and everyone of them is great. Sushi is also excellent, specially with those prices. We keep coming back!  A small hole in the wall place perfect for a cold rainy day in Pittsburgh. You feel comfortable and cozy at Burma-Tokyo with a sushi station to the left as you enter and a register to the right with simple dining tables and pictures hanging up. I didn't try the sushi but ordered the traditional Burmese noodle soup since they have Burma in their restaurant name so why not. Overall I wasn't sure what to expect but ultimately the flavors were good and there was a lot of food. Perfect to warm your belly and the price is just right. I would not have found Burma Tokyo had a friend not recommend it to me as the place is tucked into an Oakland neighborhood. Parking on the street.  Not what I was expecting -- so much better. \r\n\r\nWe came here because we had wanted to go to India Garden, but it was closed. So we were disappointed, and hungry. We came through the unassuming front door into an empty restaurant and were greeted right away and seated next to the window. \r\n\r\nWhen we told our server we intended to share 2 entrees (vegetarian), he recomendad we share 1 entre - specifically the teriyaki tofu and 1 order of soup. It was an awesome combo and the food was really good! Additionally, our server was perfectly attentive and friendly during our whole meal.\r\n\r\nI was not expecting this level of service or quality of food based on the outside (or inside for that matter) of the restaurant, but it was great and I would definitely go back.  I went here for lunch as I work nearby and found it to be a great little hole in the wall, and it's hard to find Burmese food around here.  I had a special Burmese soup and also tried one of their sushi roles and found both to be excellent.  The prices for maki rolls look a little high but they actually give you more pieces than a typical place--the one I ordered came with 12 pieces.  The service was also fast and friendly and it seems to be a family run place.  Prices are very reasonable.  The atmosphere is fairly plain.  I was hoping to love this place, having become a fan of Burmese food while living in NYC. Unfortunately I\'ve got to give it three stars; not because the food  was average overall, but because some of it was great and some of it was... not great.\r\n\r\nThe samosas and summer rolls were both very nice, with the summer rolls a little thick and gummy for my taste but stuffed nicely (and with avocado -- new to me for summer roll purposes, but welcome).\r\n\r\nHere we get to the hit-and-miss section. The "Myanmar Shan Tribe Noodle" was pungent, peppy and delicious, though more of a noodle soup than the menu made it sound. It would be a 5\\/5 if judged on this dish alone.\r\n\r\nWe also got the Thai Basil Leaf Chicken, being one of our litmus test Thai dishes, and the Malaysia style fried rice. The latter I was expecting to be somewhat like Nasi Goreng, the Indonesian version, but it was very moist, almost like risotto, and somewhat bland. I could taste the salted fish but none of the spice I was expecting.\r\n\r\nThe Thai Basil Leaf Chicken was almost entirely tasteless. I\'m not sure how you can make a Thai recipe tasteless -- it seems like you\'d have to go out of your way to do it -- so we were very confused. The initial spoonful each was all we could muster.\r\n\r\nI think Burma-Tokyo is very much a 5\\/5 if you order the right thing, and sadly rather less than that if you don\'t.  Very disappointed in this restaurant after reading a good review in the City Paper and good reviews here. We ordered vegetable samosas as an appetizer, which we planned to share; a Burmese dish, shan tribe noodle bowl with chicken, pickled vegetables and tomato sauce as one entree; and dan pauk, a chicken-and-rice dish from India as another entree.\r\n\r\nOddly, the shan tribe noodle bowl arrived first, right out of the microwave, and insufficiently heated. The flavors were somewhat interesting, but we were clearly being served leftovers. We finished that, waited awhile, and then the samosas arrived, extremely greasy but tasty. Another long wait, and then the chicken and rice arrived. More reheated leftovers--a big reheated chicken leg on top of rice that seemed like it was scraped from the inside of a pan. Blecch. \r\n\r\nThe service, in short, was awful and the food was not much better. Avoid this place.  Sumai opened up our late lunch\\/early dinner this past Saturday and instantly caused me to reevaluate my tastes; the Chinese potsticker now has a serious challenger in my own pocket dietary universe. There is now turmoil. This is unprecedented. \r\n\r\nFilled with shrimp (pork is the other option), these miniature, absolutely aperitive cylinders were doughy, meaty, meltaway Nirvana. A half-dozen was not enough, but don\'t the very best starters always leave you wanting more?\r\n\r\nKyawe Oae, a mindbender of a Burmese rice noodle soup, was on tap for me, and included chicken broth, quail eggs (!), mustard leaves, shrimp balls, fish balls, chicken balls, and pork balls. \r\n\r\nTesticular jokes went out of vogue by 9th grade, ok Beavis? You too Butthead. \r\n\r\nMoving on, the "balls" were tiny spheres of the aforementioned meats, making this into a sort of exotic, delightful Italian Wedding Soup (do we have a progenitor here?). The rice noodles were pure, edible silk. The quail eggs had somewhat rubbery whites but made up for it with yolks that were sheer velvet. My portion was quite large and easily made for a hearty meal. \r\n\r\nKay got a sushi\\/sashimi combo, and I\'m so over sushi and sashimi (it tastes the same wherever I have it) that partake in one morsel I did not. \r\n\r\nThe Lime Juice, my chosen beverage, was interesting in that it was a room temperature, vaguely biting lime-aide. I could have gone for something cold to drink aside from the water to tell the truth, but perhaps that\'s the way it\'s traditionally served. \r\n\r\nThe service was competent and genial, and as it was with r.h.\'s experience, we had the whole joint to ourselves. I never thought such an intimate place existed in busy, student-laden Oakland, but it does and thoroughly deserves more commerce.  I love this place! It's a little hole-in-the-wall in Oakland. It's a very homely place. The owners are very friendly and talkative. The food is great. It's not too oily and creamy. The food has simple distinct flavors that are hard to find in other restaurants. It doesn't feel like heavy restaurant food, but more like home made food. The vegetables are fresh. I've even had their sushi and liked it. I've tried almost all of their entrees and have enjoyed all of them. It's a simple little homely place.  After living in Oakland for four and a half years I finally decided to try this restaurant and it did not disappoint. I got Miso soup, Thai Basil Leaf with Beef and a Coke. Everything was really delicious (although I would recommend trying the Tom Yum soup instead) and it all came out to less than 10 dollars.\r\n\r\nEven thought the place doesn't look that appetizing, it is definitely worth a taste.  Went their last night with a friend and loved it. I had a Nepalese dish served with roti and two samosas that was really good. My friend had a Cambodian coconut-curry chicken that was out of this world!  I also recommend the Lao mint chicken and the Indian Biryani. \r\n\r\nThe waitress was really friendly, chatting with us about her native Myanmar. Has a large selection of authentic Burmese cooking along with SE Asian and Indian food. Also has some very interesting sushi rolls.  This is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh if not the best with regard to flavors, price and service.  I have eaten there dozens of times.  Some of my favorite dishes are Thi Saun Hin veggy soup, fish curry, California roll, Kaung Pond Kyaw veggies, Shan tribe noodles (although it is a bit too spicy for me) and samosa, although it is a bit greasy.  The owners are extremely accommodating and they will serve brown instead of white rice, including in the sushi, at no extra charge.  In fact I am heading there now for lunch and my wife and I will take a friend there for dinner tonight.  I think that it is the only restaurant in which I ever eat twice in one day.  Came here with a cadre of grad school friends (aka experts on cheap asian cuisine) and we all found it an outstanding experience,  Notable dishes were the Shan tribe noodle soup, Kyar san hingar and the "India" chicken which had a degree of tenderness I\'ve never seen replicated outside of my grandmother\'s slow roasted recipe.  The owner is personable and helpful.  Spicy actually means spicy here, so I recommend the Lime juice as an excellent way to wash it all down.  I got the Kyawe Soup which is a rice noodle soup. Really tasty and reminds me of food I get at home. My friend got the Kyar San Hingar which is a similar noodle soup and just as good. Didn't try the sushi, but my friend got the 16 piece and they gave him 20. Owners were really nice.  Lived down the street for two years. The way this man fried chicken for general tso's was REVOLUTIONARY.  Decided to give such highly reviewed Americanized Asian food for once and immediately regretted it. "Why not give it a try," we thought to ourselves. Everyone knows it\'s not "authentic," but people are saying that the food is delightful. I ordered a sweet and sour pork, friend ordered the General Tso\'s, both lunch specials. \r\n\r\nWe both opened our small boxes (I guess the size fits the price) and found, on the left side, a bunch of meat chunks smothered in sauce, and some white rice on the right side. Only difference was that sweet and sour was bright red, while General Tso\'s was brownish orange. Two tiny sad pieces of broccoli in the latter and some onion and bell pepper pieces drowned in the former. "Okay... well maybe it\'ll taste good despite its appearance," we thought.\r\n\r\nWe each took a bite of both, followed by self-reflecting thoughts on what sins we committed recently to be subjected to such painful karma. We literally could not even tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. On the outside there was no crispiness; on the inside the meat was hard and stringy instead of tender. The worst part were the sauces. They were disgustingly dense and heavy, both too sweet and overwhelming. It was a miracle that we could even taste the differences between the two.\r\n\r\nSo here we were, trying to stomach these chunks of "meat" lavishly dressed in two types of sauce. We couldn\'t take any bite without accompanying it without rice. Oh right, the rice. It was so obviously western style rice that it wasn\'t funny. You would think that they would at least get Asian rice to go with their dishes, but nope. The wonton soup didn\'t help things either. The soup tasted completely of MSG, and the wontons were mostly hard pieces of flour skins with a tidbit of meat inside. Lovely.\r\n\r\nThe place itself is dirty and revolting. The floors, the counters, the signs, the trash can, the out of order soda machine. You would think the owners could put some effort into making the place look better, but nope. I guess it\'s to cater to those loyal customers who have grown up on this "food" for more of a homely feel.\r\n\r\nSeriously, stay as far away from this place as possible. Unless you are homeless or a broke college student (or just like eating loads of sauce), nearby Sichuan Gourmet and Rose Tea are undoubtedly better choices.  Such a strange restaurant.  \r\n\r\n1)  It is filthy.  Hard to get around this.\r\n2)  The portions are very generous.\r\n3)  We were told 25 minutes for our take out.  After we arrived at the place (25 minutes in) there was no sign of our food.  When we asked they said that it wasn't ready yet.  OK...  Then we were ignored for half an hour as seven different other take out customers got their order with little or no wait.\r\n3.5)  While we waited we were smoked out by fires in the kitchen three times!  Thick black smoke that made it difficult to breathe! \r\n4)  The food was OK when we got it not the best or worst chinese food that I have ever had and certainly not worth the wait.\r\n5)  They don't take credit cards?!?\r\n\r\nWill not be returning...  Just had another great meal from Zaw's.  I have tried something different every time I've gone there and they do not disappoint.    \r\n\r\nI love Zaw's and will go back soon.  This is a memorial review, because after tonight, Zaws will be closed, and I will miss them, because they are some of the nicest people you would meet in Pittsburgh, and watching them cook in the open kitchen was quite a treat. I'm sad to see them go.  Nice place .... Dishes are very tasty .. Tried Schezwan Chicken, Egg Roll and Fried Rice and they were amazing ... Though the look of the restaurant is a bit old but food quality is good !!  Lil bit spicy?  Yes please!  My go to for a nice spicy fried.  The veggies are fresh, the food is cheap, and they stuff it to the brim.  I always order it a little bit spicy, yes I say those exact words!  If you say spicy - watch out!  Believe me it's too much, and I love sweat dripping off your forehead kind of spice.  The veggie fried rice is the only thing that I can comment on, because it's the only thing I have ever ordered from this place.  It's a total dive - but I kinda love places like these.  Definitely check it out if you are in the area.  But give yourself some time to order and pick up.  They are always busy, and wait time is minimum 25 minutes.  This is definitely not fast food Chinese...  We're still looking, but nothing in the Bay Area compares to Zaw's.  The sesame chicken with a little spice...yum!  Each serving is cooked to order (over HUGE flames--wish my range could do that) . MMMM.  Good Chinese-American food, tasty and fresh.  I think this place is Pittsburgh's best-kept secret.  The typical American-Chinese dishes are fine, but the other stuff is what's really great.  My favorites are the coconut chicken curry, the roast pork with garlic noodles, and the Malaysian beef fried rice.  Order extra spicy and you really get extra spicy.  Also, the won ton soup is gingery and scalliony and the best medicine for a cold.  You get what you pay for. Their lunch special is dirt cheap--under $5 for an entr\xc3\xa9e, with rice and a side of soup. I got the sweet and sour chicken, which was a mistake because the sauce was so sweet it tasted like a fruit cocktail. For the side of soup, I got the hot and sour soup. It tasted nothing like hot and sour soup, and it looked nothing like hot and sour soup. It tasted more like a beef stew with chunks of tofu. The food was made when ordered, so no doubt about the freshness. However, I didn't think the lunch special was that tasty. My first dinning experience here with the sweet and sour chicken was a disaster. DO NOT get the sweet and sour chicken! As for the rest of the menu, I'm not sure if I have the courage to venture back here.  Best Asian food in the city!!!! \r\n\r\nThough there are a few (and very minor) drawbacks: Must pay cash, place is old and a bit dirty on the customer end,  this food is fabulous! Fresh chicken, beef, shrimp, pork and veggies (also tofu dishes as well). Forget about that hammered-thin chicken filled with MSG you see so often in Asian fast-food restaurants. You can see them prepare every morsel of your food; 100% fresh! Zaw\'s is as fresh as it gets. Like spice? Get it as hot as you want (if you ask for spicy, it\'s gonna be SPICY). I have tried many of the items on the menu and found about 5 that I rotate every time I order. Trust me!!!! I have been eating there for over 12 years. once you find your dish, you will be craving it at 6 in the morning. \r\n\r\nOnce Sonny, one of the owners, learns your name and the dishes you enjoy, He will recognize your voice on the phone and know your order before you can make it. The three staff: husband, wife and brother are loving, personable people who deliver great food for an unbelievable price. \r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\r\n1) Order by phone. When Sonny says it will be 45 minutes, it will probably be close to an hour and 15 minutes if you want to just run in and pick up your food. If you go "on time" you will wait as the make your food fresh right in front of you. Don\'t worry! Your food is given to you hot and fresh; don\'t get discouraged as other customers come in and get their food before you. It is ALWAYS busy, but these customers have waited at home for at least an hour and 15 minutes... worth the wait.\r\n\r\n2) Try it more than once and try several dishes. This IS NOT you average Asian food take out. It may take 2-3 times to find what you like, but...worth the wait.\r\n\r\n3) If you enjoy a bit of spice DO NOT ask for extra spice. The food is a tiny bit spicy in all the dishes I\'ve tried (about 20 different dishes). To add spice it to get it SPICY (which I love). \r\n\r\n4) Do not concern yourself with the restaurant itself. It is old and a bit dirty, but once you eat the food and meet Sonny and the other staff, you will know that the food prep and kitchen is well up to standards. There is a reason it is take out only and so popular, not just with people who enjoy a hole-in-the -wall food place, but all walks of Pittsburgh people who enjoy great food.\r\n\r\n5) Be a regular customer. Sonny and his family make you feel like you are the only customer that matters at Zaw\'s, but here is a secret: he does it to every single return customer (and there are a lot of them). Feel free to adjust your meal to suit your needs. My wife asks for all-white meat chicken in the General T-so\'s Chicken (know it\'s not spelled correctly, but this is not your average meal) and I get extra onions in my Pork Lo Mein .\r\n\r\nTry it a few times, find what you like and I promise you you will not be able to live without Zaw\'s Asian food.\r\n\r\nP.S. I had it last night!  Never waited more then they tild me to wait food on point everytime lo main with extra beef very good egg roll very good.. the owner does its job good..very simple.. I love it! And u can NOT beat the price $$$$  This place is great.  A friend (who used to live nearby) recommended it to me a few years ago and I've been going there for almost 6 years now.  It's got some of the best Asian food I've ever had.  The chicken chow fun, sesame chicken, and delights of three are some personal favorites.  Highly recommend for east asian food if you live in Squirrel Hill.  We've been ordering from Zaws for over 7 years. We have tried many asian places in Pittsburgh and we keep coming back to Zaws. \r\n\r\nThe food is fresh (that's why it takes close to 40 minutes) not microwaved or just recooked like at most asian places you see. \r\n\r\nBest general tso chicken and Mongolian beef by far. The owner, Sonny, is the nicest man you'll ever meet and know your name by no time. \r\n\r\nGreat place! Great food! Great people!  I just had my steam veggie take out tonight. The veggie is not very fresh and tofu is about to go bad. Without sauces, you can taste the freshness of the dish. I will not return.  The best general tso! Saucy, spicy and very fresh. You can't beat the lunch special. Let's face it, this place isn't much on the inside and some may say it is dirty, but the food is excellent!  Since moving here from CA a few months ago, I've been on the search for good chinese food.  Growing up on some of the best SF has to offer, I'm a tough critic.  But I have one dish that I order at every chinese restaurant and that is beef chow fun.  I love it! I love it without a gravy and I've eaten so much of it in my life I sometimes wonder if I'm not going to turn into a noodle one day.\r\n\r\nWell we had been hearing all of these magical things about the food at Zaw's and how it is the best chinese food around, blah blah blah.  \r\n\r\nSo one day we decided to try it, we made sure to have cash on us and were excited for the meal ahead.  Well I ordered my beef chow fun and asked for it 'dry and with bean sprouts' well he told me NO! They didn't do it with bean sprouts and used other veggies but cooked it in the normal way, not in a gravy and it will be good.  I came in a gravy and it wasn't good! Maybe if I ate it right when I got it instead of taking it home, because when I got home the gravy had been soaked up by the top layer of the noodles leaving the bottom ones sauce less and tastesless, the top was breaking apart and the flavors didn't balance.  \r\n\r\nWe also ordered some other dishes but those too fell short.  I'm not shocked and amazed by zaw's.  \r\n\r\nBut if I'm ordering the wrong thing, please someone tell me! What do you order that is so amazing it keeps you going back?! And do you take it home and eat or eat right there? I'll give it another try, I won't be getting my chow fun there but I'll try something else, I have to give chinese food a second chance, if not I'll be a noodleless asian girl and that's sad!  I love mom & pop places. Zaw's is the best! I live close so I always get there before my food is done just to watch them cook. The kitchen does look dingy but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic. The gentleman behind the burner is so quick and knows the recipes by heart, the son (I'm assuming) takes care of the orders and register and he is extremely kind. Everything is made to order even the hot & sour soup (which is the best I've ever had, seriously). I like to try new things each time I order but I'm stuck on the coconut curry tofu. Forget LuLu's, Howe Lee, New Dumpling House, and all of the other Chinese places, go to Zaw's instead.  I have loved this place for so long and I can't believe I never thought to review it on Yelp!  They serve delicious and fresh food.   My personal favorite is the Sesame Tofu and Shrimp Egg  Rolls.  Great food and awesome people.\r\n\r\nP.S. Those people behind the counter, working diligently to make you an awesome meal would probably appreciate a dollar or two in the tip jar.  Anyone that's giving this place a bad review is actually an idiot. This place is freakin amazing!! Everything is made to order in front of you, fresh, delicious, and the meat is always amazing as well as the sauces. I've lived in a lot of places and eaten a lot of Asian food (Seattle and NYC, 18 years and 5 years). This is some of the best Chinese I've ever had.  This place is disgusting. The level of filth is off putting as soon as you walk in. I saw the cook lick his finger and blow his nose without washing his hands within 5 minutes. This place should be shut down. Stay away.  This is the best Chinese food I\'ve had in Pittsburgh.  The owner is exceedingly polite, and the food that ancient looking kitchen kicks out is delicious and served in large portions.  If you\'re looking for "authentic" Chinese food, I\'m not sure how well this stacks-up.  I\'ve spent time in Beijing and Hong Kong, but really have no idea what "authentic" Chinese food is.  This place does great American Chinese food though.  I wouldn\'t eat in if you were looking for anything other than a dive atmosphere.  I have a hard time understanding some of the negative reviews of Zaw\'s.  Is it authentic? - No.  Is it fresh and delicious? - YES!!!  I\'ll admit that I was a skeptic at first, but gave it a try on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.  I\'ve been steadily working my way through the menu and everything I\'ve had is good.  Some of my favorites are Lo Mein (any kind), Sesame Chicken, and Hunan Beef.  The items on the menu that are indicated as spicy are actually spicy... so watch it if you ask for anything "spicy" that is already supposed to be spicy.  I normally order my Lo Mein spicy, and it can be dangerously hot depending on the day... but it\'s a good burn.  Everything they make is exceedingly fresh and the flavors are tremendous.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re more comfortable paying double for a place that "has tables", "takes credit cards" or "has a kitchen you can\'t see", then Zaw\'s is not for you.  Try Jimmy Wan\'s or any of the other "fancy" Chinese restaurants in town.  Otherwise - enjoy!  this must be that hole inthe wall i still dream about. tis true -the burmese chicken curry with coconut rice is great. friendly owners too  How the @$#%&?! do you screw up rice and call yourself an Asian place? \r\n\r\nI don't understand those who say this is the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I drove here from Oakland based on the reviews, but the rolling cart in the atrium of Newell-Simon Hall at CMU is better. This place is super, super cheap, but you get what you pay for. Cash only, no delivery. The staff are friendly, and know their regulars by face, but the food is greasy, below-average Chinese take out, and their rice is hard and undercooked. It wasn't a one-time thing, either. I went a second time (it is cheap) and the rice turned out the same. I will not be going back again, especially when I live a block from Orient Kitchen.  Is this for real? I read the menu...Lo Mein, Beef and Broccoli, Chicken and Black Bean sauce, pretty much everything Asian you can wish for.\r\n\r\nThe beef packs zing, the sauce is sweet, and the broccoli provides the tongue appeal. This is an amazing dish that only Zaw\'s can provide correctly.\r\n\r\nWithout the outrageous prices.\r\n\r\nDelicious. I had no idea that such a hole in the wall could be so satisfying.\r\n\r\nLike savoring the goodness of a true Beef and Broccoli dish without worrying about breaking your bank.\r\nIngredients;\r\n\r\nBeef - Yes, overwhelmingly.\r\n\r\nThe sauce - That explains the sweetness. \r\n\r\nBroccoli - The alkaline feel of the veggie on my tongue comes from the Broccoli.\r\n\r\nChicken - Chicken, yes, that provides the full bodied, protein sensation.\r\n\r\nBlack Bean Sauce - More zing!\r\n\r\nAnd the manager\\/cashier, Sonny is an absolute doll. We\'ve ordered from him so many times that he is now proud to call us "his friend" and always asks how we are doing.\r\n\r\nOkay, I\'ll admit that the atmosphere is nothing to write home about and it is odd that they don\'t take credit cards.\r\n\r\nI don\'t care.\r\n\r\nThis is great Asian food.  We tried Zaw's as a recommendation from friends.  It is take out only, but for a quick Friday after work dinner it hit the spot.  I am not a huge Chinese food fan.  But I definitely liked the food.  The egg rolls were fresh and not super greasy.   I had some veggie Lo Mein that was delicious!  (The the left overs were great the next day too!) I asked for the Lo Mein spicy and it delivered.  Apparently all their food is a little spicy to begin with so if you ask for it spicy be ready!  It did not disappoint.  My fiance, who LOVES Chinese food, really liked this place too.  He said it is not the best he has ever had, but certainly would ea here again!  We are excited to try some other things on the menu.\r\nLike I said it is take out only and cash only.  They are also preparing thing fresh so it takes a little bit of time to prepare.  We ordered at 430 and picked up at 5.  I think the prices are very reasonable also.  This is a really great neighborhood take-out place; we\'ve been getting food here for many years. But pay attention to the "Asian" in the title; these are not Chinese people and they do dishes other than the expected standards. Also, this is not the place for your romantic once-in-a-lifetime gastronomic adventure; it\'s a place that gives you consistently good, well prepared, food, on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThe folks in there are from Burma (brother, sister, husband thereof); they make food that seems to be from all over. Since this is the U.S., most of the menu is standard Chinese-American, but check out the dishes listed on the right-hand side of the menu. There\'s a real range. In particular the curried dishes are invariably yummy.\r\n\r\nOrdering by phone is the right thing to do. Sonny would always tell me (it seemed) that your order will be ready in "40 minutes". For a while I was puzzled by this, especially since the food never seemed to be ready at the promised time. Eventually I figured out that they wait for you to show up and then make your meal  and so you end up with fresh made dishes. We\'re regular customers, so this works out. You probably have to go there a number of times before they start to recognize you on the phone.\r\n\r\nI\'m a bit puzzled by some of the other reviews: you\'re not going to get something just like what you got in some particular West Coast eatery; eating out is about variety, and being open to different approaches. In any case, if you want to be picky, in my experience none of the stuff in this country is anything like what you get in mainland China (where the cuisine is just totally way better).\r\n\r\nAmong the things that I like about this place is that they cook everything to order (I can\'t believe someone compared Zaw\'s to the vendor at CMU that serves almost everything from a steam table; yuk). Certain dishes stand out: I hate to use this one as the example, but their General T\'so chicken is (I think) the best I\'ve had in the city. Many other places treat this as a "chicken-flavored fried dough" dish. Zaw\'s does it right: the batter is very thin and the chicken is all white. It tastes as a chicken dish; who cares if there\'s a bit too much sauce? Yes, I know that T\'so\'s is not "real" Chinese, but I believe that Zaw\'s preparation of it tells you what you need to know about their general approach.\r\n\r\nI should point out that there\'s also some real losers on the menu. But so what? Just figure out the bits that you enjoy and go for it.  Awesome Chinese takeout. You can get your dish made spicy, but be careful it'll be extremely spicy. Another cash only place on Murray Ave.  Fantastic! Every time I come back to PGH, I eat here. My choice? The Szechuan Bean Curd. Cheap. Plentiful. Super yummy. Eat here now.  I was a die hard Zaw's fan for years, however, after last night's takeout, it may be awhile before I go back. I ordered chicken lo mein, after a few bites, I noticed I began tasting small clumps of salt in my lo mein!! To my dismay, the entire container contained small clumps of salt. So, not the best experience I've ever had from Zaw's but the samosas that I always order were delicious as ever.  Hands down, best Asian food ever...seriously EVER.\r\n\r\nYou will not find anything better in any city.\r\n\r\nOkay, okay...it's small, doesn't deliver, doesn't take cash and the walls have gotten progressively more yellowish-brown over the years but the food is amazing and better yet, it's super cheap.\r\n\r\nSonny is the guy who runs the place.  After he learns your name, believe me - he will never forget it.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend the lunch specials...4 dollars gets you a huge amount of food.\r\n\r\nA few of my favorites:\r\n\r\n- Sesame tofu\r\n- Fried bean sprouts & tofu\r\n- Lemon chicken\r\n- Szechuan Eggplant\r\n- Chicken & black bean sauce\r\n\r\nPS - Egg drop soup = best!  I am so upset about this I can't even express it. The curry chicken here was my favorite thing to eat to the point where I would consider it as a last meal. It was a red spicy curry sauce with garlic and ginger and chicken broth. I will miss it so much  I love this little place. I used to live around the corner and would go here all the time. The owner is really nice. It reminds me of a place where you might be able to buy a Mogwai. I always get the General Tso's chicken. They cook it right in front of you in a wok that has probably seen more chicken than colonel sanders. It actually might be the original wok. \r\n\r\nThe thing I love about this place is that it doesn't try to be anything more than it is: an old, kinda dirty, delicious, little Chinese takeout joint. Very genuine.  Food is always good and consistently the same.  The owner is probably the nicest man you will ever meet.  This place is a hole in the wall and it is take out only but i reccomend it to anyone who wants quality cheap takeout.  Really gonna miss this place. Been ordering there for years. They know who you are and what you like whenever you call. Very sad to see this place go. Their food was perfection.  2011: I just changed a plane flight to eat at Zaw\'s. That\'s how much I love their General Tso\'s. Have been searching for years for something similar that I don\'t have to fly to eat, but so far have failed.\r\n\r\n2013: Zaws is still a hole-in-the wall and still my favorite Asian food I\'ve ever found. The things people mention in other reviews, such as the cleanliness of the floors, and unrealistic time estimates on the phone are all true, but I\'ve always found the food and the personal attention to be well worth it. I\'ve lived in several other cities since Pittsburgh, but still make a point of eating at Zaws every time I\'m in town.\r\n\r\n2015: Still here and still Zaws. I\'m sitting here at what is almost always my last stop on my way out of Pittsburgh. I really don\'t care how "authentic" to anything their General Tso\'s is, the sweet and spicy with big chunks of chicken is still how I want it.  This is what Chinese takeout should be.  This is old school American Chinese food.  Everything is fresh and made to order from scratch & cheap.  It's like a really good Chinese greasy spoon.  Had the Chop Suey, Singapore noodles, and dumplings.  Everything was really awesomely flavored.  \r\n\r\nYou know that scene in Blade Runner when Gaff finds Deckard at the noodle shop?  That's what the Singapore noodles taste like.  That scene.  I'm biased against American-Chinese food, since I ate Chinese home cooking most of my childhood.  I'm giving Zaw's 3 stars, but I can see why it's gotten higher ratings here.\r\n\r\nIf you can, call in your order before you head to the eatery.  Zaw's isn't speedy, but that's a good thing, as each dish is freshly made and piping hot.  I like how the tofu is prepared--it's not overly fried or spongy, but just right.  My favorite dish is the fried bean-sprouts and tofu.  The sauce  for the sesame tofu was way too thick--oh, hey, cornstarch--and too sweet, but I think the dish is meant for someone with more of a Western palate.  The coconut tofu here has the perfect amount of spice, but I found the vegetables, which are $1 extra--the dish is normally just curry and tofu cubes--kind of disappointing, as they were just some random carrot and onion slices and some slivers of water chestnuts.  I'm aware that I've only talked about tofu dishes here, but I'm pretty sure they use similar bases for sesame chicken and the coconut curry chicken.\r\n\r\nEven though all the previous reviewers have already said this, I think it bears repeating: the staff is extremely nice, so nice that I feel like a horrible human being for not loving everything I've ordered.  Zaw's won't cure my cravings for childhood foods, but I'll keep going back.  felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top  This place is a hole in the wall but oh my, these cheap eats are fantastic! The sweet and sour chicken is fantastic according to my picky friends! I loved the eggplant! \r\nWhile the place may look a little beat up and grimey you get a great view of your food being made fresh in a fiery fashion! Will be returning!  Either I had an unusual experience at Zaw's or everyone in Pittsburgh needs to venture out of state to find real authentic Chinese food.\r\n\r\nThe high reviews from Yelp encouraged my drive from Rivers Casino all the way to Zaw's.  I called ahead and they kindly told me that they'd be open till 10pm tonight. I was excited because I was craving Chinese food!\r\n\r\nThe cashier (whom I will assume is the owner) was extremely kind and friendly.  I ordered a large Pork Chow Mein and General Tso's Chicken.  Just FYI, this is really expensive Chinese fast food!! I was born and raised in San Francisco so I suppose that may have played a large factor.  But $7.95 for a large chow mein and $8.95 for the chicken is outrageous (or it would be in the west coast)!  I told myself this had to be amazing for what they're charging.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine my disappointment when I opened up the chow mein to find that it wasn't even chow mein!! It did have pork, but there were NO NOODLES. All I had in that red and white take out box was thin slices of roast pork, a big batch of cooked BEAN SPROUTS, and an overwhelming amount of SAUCE?!? i was so upset that I paid $8 for it.  I've taken a picture so please tell me this was just a huge mistake.  There are absolutely no noodles in my chow mein.  I didn't pay for a big box of cheap bean sprouts.  I have no idea how this happened because I even watched the cook make it from my seat on one of their bar stools! We must both be blind. Zaw's had the nicest man in the world working there but I do hope they read this as to make sure they don't make the same mistake with anyone else.\r\n\r\nThe General Tso's Chicken wasn't so great either.  They put way too much sauce on everything! That is some THICKKKK sauce they're using. My boyfriend found it decent but I may have already been scarred by the chow mein.\r\n\r\nI was starving and upset so we ventured off to Primanti Bro's nearby since our chinese take out didn't make the cut.  I have been going to Zaw's since 1995. Excellent food for a decent price. I now live in O'Hara Township and still order food from Zaw's.  Sonny, Phillip, and Esther are wonderful people and have always treated me nicely. Yes, it can take up to an hour for the food, but well worth it.  Zaw\'s is, hands down, the best Chinese food in Squirrel Hill. Everything I have ordered has always been fresh, hot, and most importantly, delicious.\r\n\r\nBut it\'s not just the good food that endears this place to me. The gentleman that runs this establishment is the nicest man I have ever met, and he sealed my loyalty on my second visit about a year ago.\r\n\r\nI arrived to pick up my food, only to realize I was short about $5. My girlfriend volunteered to walk to a nearby ATM, while I stayed behind. After about 30 seconds, the owner picked up my order, held it out to me, and told me to take it and I could pay him back next time. This was only my second time in his restaurant, and he was trusting me to not just take the food and conveniently "forget" to pay him back.\r\n\r\nSo, good food and good people? Why would you go anywhere else?  Very tasty General Tso's chicken. The preparation time was fairly short and was cooked right in front of me as I waited. There's not a lot of room for seating, and the plasticware provided for my eat-in order was flimsy, but overall very good.  This is your prototypical hole-in-the-wall Chinese place that isn't low on ambience, it's non-existent but high on quality. \r\n\r\nFood is prepared in front of you by a 113 yr old former Tai Chi master. And...there is an awesome pile of16 yr old National Geographics on the counter for you to read while your meal is being freshly prepared.\r\n\r\nWhat more could you ask for?  This was the first place I ate at when I moved to Squirrel Hill, it was WORTH IT! Affordable, quick, and above all delicious. The inside of the shop isn't pretty, but don't let that fool you (it's take-out, who cares?). The man that owns the shop is also incredibly nice and polite- he'll be the one answering the phone and cashing you out. Highly highly recommended.  I was driving through Squirrel Hill today , and decided that Chinese would hit the spot . I did not know this was a " take out "  only kinda place. ....Food was ok I guess, I did not get a fortune cookie or any additional sauces. The place looks dirty as many other reviewers had mentioned.\r\nNot sure if I could recommend this place. kinda on the fence.  This is the definition of a hole in the wall.  It's take-out only; there's maybe four seats in the place, meant mostly for you to hang out while your food is cooked.  They don't deliver.  They're often busy.\r\n\r\nPutting that all together, if a restaurant doesn't deliver, and doesn't have any seating, and has a stream of people through the door... the food has to fill the gap.  And it does.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the sesame tofu.  Need to stop back again soon.  This is a great take out place in Squirrell Hill (Murray & Hobart). We order from here almost every other week.  Almost always get the same dish-- Burmese Chicken Curry.  The great thing about this place is that they make every dish to order rather than premaking it... you can watch the cook make the food when you go to pick up.  They have good hot and sour soup too.  Great Chinese food.  Very spicy great lunch prices  This is a MSG-injected chinese takeout place.  My expectations were pretty low, but I visited because of the positive reviews Zaw's received on Yelp.  \r\n\r\nMy initial reaction was negative, because they do not accept credit cards and the non-kitchen area was filthy... leaving me wondering when the last time I received a tetanus shot.\r\n\r\nHowever, I gave them four stars, because they followed through on what matters.  Mainly, the food was cooked to order before my very own two eyes.  While the entrance is dirty, the kitchen appeared sanitary.  The ingredients were of a higher quality than I expected: fresh veggies and higher quality pork.  I walked a half of a mile home, and my food was still piping hot.  The portions were generous.\r\n\r\nI would eat from here again, but will not recommend to friends, because the place looks sketchy.  Is the restaurant dirty? Yes, yes it is.  And I have no problem with that.  \r\n\r\nThe people working are always super nice, when I order something "super spicy" they actually manage to do that, the prices are super low, and (with exception of the egg rolls) the food is always tasty.  When I asked my dad what he was most looking forward to in retirement, amongst his list he included, "Saving money by not paying for lunch in the cafeteria."  My father for the past 33 years had worked at a Junior High School in Mesa, Arizona.  I laughed, asking him how much he possibly could have paid for lunch in the school\'s cafeteria.  He told me, "around three dollars," and I good-naturedly teased him and we had a good laugh over the fact that there was no restaurant in the world where he would find a better lunch deal.\r\n\r\nThis was BEFORE I knew about the Zaw\'s lunch special.  Far from Mesa, AZ, on Murray Ave. in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA you will find the most delicious Chinese Mandarin food you have ever tasted.  Zaw\'s lunch special includes full meals for less than three dollars.  How is this even possible??  For those of you cynics thinking that the portions must be ridiculously small, or the food be not tasty--I assure you, neither is the case.\r\n\r\nSonny, the owner\\/manager (we are not sure, but he\'s been around a long time) goes out of his way to shake your hand, learn your name, and remember it--even if you haven\'t been in for multiple years!  Marvin, the cook who speaks less English is just as friendly if not as verbal as he whips up sesame tofu, rice, lemon chicken, Szechuan eggplant, and a variety of other dishes.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of greasy-hole-in-the-wall Chinese that actually isn\'t greasy at all--that\'s my kind of Chinese food!  It will however satisfy your cravings that sometimes only greasy-hole-in-the-wall Chinese can alleviate. \r\n\r\nGo here for the lunch special.  Go here for a good time.  Go here to meet Sonny and Marvin. Go here for good food.  Bottom line: Go here.\r\n\r\nJust to let you know: Cash only, no delivery, limited seating (get it as take-out, or eat it on the stoop next door and people watch Murray Ave.)  Excellent:  charming service, clean and attractive, and of course the burgers and fries.\r\nCould be better:  parking. \r\nWe'll definitely go back. Thanks Fred!  The burgers and fries here are SOOOO good!!the people that work there are really nice. I wouldn't recommend it as a special date night dinner. It is more of a causal quick dinning for family's.  A little short staffed during our visit, but extremely friendly counter service and drop dead delicious burgers!  If you are looking for a cook to order, amazing burger, Five Guys is the spot.\r\nI have been to a few other locations, but was very impressed with my stop today.\r\nService was on point and the restaurant was very clean with several tables inside and out.\r\n\r\nI ordered a Cheeseburger with Mayo, Lettuce and Pickles and a "Little" Fry.\r\nI didn\'t realize the Cheeseburger was a double burger but no worries.  However, will probably go with the "Little" next time.\r\nWith that said, one of the juiciest cooked burgers I have had in a long time. They put just the right amount of toppings...still dreaming about it!\r\nThe fries are also so fresh, cut and fried to order so you will never get a bad batch.  Just add some salt to the bag and you are set!\r\n\r\nAnd, don\'t forget to grab some peanuts while you wait!  Excellent ambiance, great speedy service. Gave us two burgers for free because they wanted us to do well in our lacrosse tournament. Caring workers at this joint!!  Just had a great experience here!! The wait staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to accommodate the customer. The burgers are so fresh and cooked and prepared to perfection!  Love their fries. Oh yeah, don't forget about peanuts. This South Blvd is the best.  In times when only a burger will suffice, I have found that Five Guys is the way to go. The service is friendly and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe regular burgers have two patties and the "mini" has only one. The fries are pleniful and more than enough to share. I like how they will load your burger with all the works! They also offer veggie or cheese sandwiches for the meatless crowd. You can dine without breaking the bank and it will fill you up!\r\n\r\nI especially appreciate the cleanliness. As I was eating, I noticed that if the employees were not making someone\'s order, they were cleaning.\r\n\r\nMy only wish is that they offered milkshakes, but then again their name says it all.  This place made me happy in pants! I recently tried 5 Guys while visiting my folks in Tennessee, and my parents loved it! (and they\'re picky eaters) I\'ve visited the location on South Blvd a few times now and all I can say is WOW!\r\nThe burgers are inexpensive but full of flavor. All of the sides are included free of charge (like grilled onions, green peppers, lettuce, tomatos, mushrooms, etc) and you tell them what sides you want on your burger. Of course, sheese & bacon are extra. Made fresh to order. The "little burger" is a single patty of meat whereas the "burger" is 2 patties of meat. They also offer hot dogs, but I haven\'t tried one yet. My mom had the hot dog and loved it!\r\nThe fries are just sex! Simply due to the portions that you get. (2 sizes available: reg. & lg.) but they put your fries in the bag them heap another scoop of fries on top of that. MAGNIFICIENT! Fries are available in regular or cajun flavors, I suggest the cajun... not overpowering but enough spice to add flavor.\r\nWhile you\'re waiting, feel free and grab some of the free peanuts and eat them while your order is being prepared. \r\n\r\nWarning: no plates or silverware. (which I LOVE!!) Just a greased soaked brown paper bag. Feel free and eat your goodies in the dining room or on the patio. Free refills from the coke fountain too.\r\n\r\nYou can eat very well for under 10 bucks... my colon officially hates me.  Normally a fantastic experience until tonight.  We ordered food to go and the fries had WAY TOO MUCH salt on them. Totally ruined the meal and disappointed!  Will be back but will definitely check the food before we leave.  I am from Southern California where we have a chain called "In N Out Burger" - they are the definitive of hamburger purity.. and I can honestly say, Five Guys is right up there with them. Simple menu.. like IN N OUt.. (http:\\/\\/coreytess.com\\/do-you-like-it-animal-style-relax-i-am-talking-west-coast-eats\\/) but everything on it is perfected.\r\n\r\nThe staff is friendly, they always ask your name and yell it out when you tell them your order, which is cute..  the largest burger is insanely big, so be hungry if you order that.. and an order of fries is enough for three people! You can get them seasoned or regular. Hang out and eat some peanuts from the barrel while you wait.  A really good burger and you get to say exactly what you want on it. As a previous reviewer noted, it's not as good as In -N-Out Burger, but neither do you have to scrape off a huge slather of mayo from the bun or contend with Bible verses tucked into your french fry bag. Everything's a compromise.\r\n\r\nThe small burger is plenty large and ordering a bag of fries with no one to help split them is suicidal. It's kinda spendy for a burger joint, but you get a lot of food.\r\n\r\nWhat prevents me from going more often is the very loud music (not just this location, it was the same in Middletown, CT.) I have to be in a mood to not be able to converse with my dining partner.  I love me some cow on bread.  \r\n\r\nFive Guys avoids one of the more deadly traps that befalls most burger-oriented venues: it doesn't take the hamburger too seriously.  \r\nWhen I eat a burger, I don't want Kobe beef and aged cheddar cheese.  I don't want a southwestern aioli sauce and a pretzel bread bun.  I want  damn hamburger.  \r\n\r\nFive Guys burgers are straight up burgers.  \r\nWant cheese?  You got it.  \r\nMayo?  Cool.  \r\nJalapenos?  Crisp and fiery, (unlike the brine-soaked, nancy-pants sissy slices they call jalapenos at most other places.)  \r\nWhat grade beef is it?  Tasty.\r\nWhat sort of bread is it?  It's a hamburger bun.\r\n\r\nAnd damn it, it's greasy deliciousness.\r\n\r\nAdd to all that, the fries are perfect.  Not to big; not to thin.  Greasy but crisp.  Fresh cut and fried.  Salty to no end.  \r\n\r\nFive Guys isn't fast food and it's not The Counter.  But it's a perfect blend of the two.  It's simply the most satisfying burger and fries I've had in Charlotte.  The first experience I had here was great, my normal experience at the five guys chain. I usually order a veggie sandwich with cheese and a side of Cajun fries. My first time here, the usually enormous sandwich was perfectly gooey with just the right amount of cheese you'd expect in a grilled cheese sandwich. The side of small fries was also massive. Worth the $7-8 bucks. \r\n\r\nI returned a couple of days ago and was not as pleased with my order as before. The veggie was small and lacked the cheesiness I normally get with this sandwich. The jalape\xc3\xb1os were Also cut inedibly thick, had to pick them out. I'm hoping this was an off day, it was pretty crowded. \r\n\r\nI'll be back for one more try, hopefully I will remain a returning customer.  I love this place!!! The staff is always incredibly nice and go out of their way to talk to their customers and smile! The fries are fresh cut everyday and the burgers are delicious!!  My favorite Charlotte spot to grab a cheeseburger (and fries)! \r\n\r\nI usual grab Five Guys on a Sunday night. After a long weekend, I\'m ready for something quick and delicious. I usually call ahead and they take a minute or two to get my fries ready when I arrive but no complaints because I love hot and fresh fries! \r\n\r\nMy "go to" is a cheese burger (regular sized) with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo and grilled onions. \r\n\r\nAnd they have malt vinegar is you like that on your fries.  I'd been to Five Guys before in DC, but I didn't know there was a store in Charlotte until recently. Naturally, as soon as I found out I brought my girlfriend to partake in its glory. This place is awesome. \r\n\r\nMost fast-food places don't really give you a fresh feeing. Five Guys does. Their patties are handmade and their fixins are, well, fresh. Speaking of fixins, they're all free--you just have to ask. Definitely try throwing mushrooms, onions and jalapenos on your burger. Nice combo. \r\n\r\nAnd the burgers are huge--a regular cheeseburger is two delicious patties. If you're going with a friend, plan on splitting a side of fries, 'cause it a ridiculously huge order. Try your fries with malt vinegar; it's amazing. \r\n\r\nOne thing: it's fast food, but since they cook the burgers right there in front of you, it's not all that fast. Plan on waiting a few minutes, at least. You'll be glad you did.  Came here the other day for lunch with my guy. We were both (ok I was) a little hungover from going to a concert the night before nothing major or that a greasy lunch couldn't fix. We were walking down the road and came upon five guys and thought perfect! We went in and were greeted warmly and we were able to order right away. I ordered a regular cheese burger with some toppings and my guy got some huge double patty version of what I had and we shared the Cajun fries.... If you go ALWAYS get the Cajun fries there are probably the best part. The food was good it's pretty consistent here and while it gets the job done I don't feel like I'm wowed like most of my friends. Now this could be due largely in part to the fact that 2 people can't eat for less than about 25 bucks and that's with us sharing a large fry. I will throw some money away quicker than you can wink when it comes to food - however - it just seems kinda high for just a burger and fries.... The food is good don't get me wrong but the price tag makes it kinda not worth it to me although next time I'm an extra Jameson shot in from the night before out with friends I'm sure I'll be back with no complaints however sober and in my right mind I think my wallet will lead me else where for a simple burger and fries. All in all good though! \r\n\r\nWe walked so didn't notice parking. There is outdoor seating and an easy walk from the light rail.  Awesome burger and great value.  The regular burger has two patties and and a small fry is enormous.  You aren't going home hungry or broke.  Five Guys is a carnivore's utopia.\r\n\r\nTheir seasoned fries have a Cajun style kick.  I wouldn't call this a gourmet burger like The Counter since the menu is very basic.  But it holds its own in terms of quality of beef with Big Daddy's and it's faster than any grill in town.  Plus their soda fountain selection includes Mr Pibb Xtra.  Hoo ra!  Delicious burgers & fries. The grilled cheese is always a hit with my 2 1\\/2 year-old too! As a NOVA native, I'm so excited that there is a Five Guys close to us.  I enjoy 5 Guys for one reason.  Consistent.  It is a simple concept.  They do not over promise or offer an amazingly complicated and confusing menu.\r\nStraight forward delivery.  What you see, literally, is what you get.  Good food at a fair price.  Five Guys never seems to disappoint. This location has friendly employees, quick service & perfect burgers & fries. \r\n\r\nIt always seems an employee is tidying up the restaurant at all times. It's always clean.\r\n\r\nMy little bacon burger is cooked to perfection, the bacon is crisp & the pickles always have that great dill taste. Now, the jalape\xc3\xb1os...oooh weeee, they are RIPE & hot!\r\n\r\nCajun fries are a must, but only the regular size, which are perfect for sharing!  The girl behind the counter was very welcoming and pleasant. She asked us how our weekend was going - a little thing that goes a long way for a quality experience. The restaurant was very clean, which was confirmed by their 99.0 sanitation rating on the wall. Great place & we will definitely come back!  I like Five Guys burgers.  GOOD!... I always like to get some of the peanuts to eat while waiting.  I usually hit up Five Guys when I am craving something disgusting yet utterly delicious. While I will always believe that my grandfather makes the best hamburgers and Cookout is a close second, Five Guys is pretty damn good. The first time I ever visited, I ordered a burger and a regular fry for myself which was a huge mistake. I received a burger as big as my head and a gigantic paper bag full of french fries. I didn't even make a dent in my burger and fries. Now that I am a more experienced diner, I stick to a little hamburger and split the regular fry with whoever I happen to be feasting with. The toppings are free which is awesome (except the bacon and cheese) and they also sell hot dogs. I definitely recommend Five Guys but I would definitely cool it on the large fry and the regular-sized burgers, remember: less is more.  Classic diner-style burgers and fries. If you're a fan of the West coast In-N-Out, you will probably like Five Guys and get into many heated debates on which is better.  Five Guys is located on an increasingly busy South Blvd, but luckily it has ample parking in back (unlike many South Blvd. eateries). \r\n\r\nA casual diner style with burlap sacks of potatoes stacked in the dining area and framed newspaper reviews on the walls. You stroll up to the counter and place your order. Choice of condiments and fixings, regular fries or seasoned. I got a little cheeseburger (which was plenty big) and a basket of cajun fries to share. \r\n\r\nBurgers are cooked fresh and they boast that their meat is never frozen. Their ingredients are fresh, but their basic burger, unfortunately tasted pretty basic. As for their cajun fries, they were OK, but reminded me more of BBQ seasoning on potato chips. \r\n\r\nThe Five Guys fan club is still quite the unexplained phenomena to me.  It's not a bad burger place, but it's not very noteworthy either.  Not a bad burger, but you'd think with the Zagat rating and all of the gushing reviews posted on the wall from various magazines that the burgers would be better. The burger and fries are a good size, even for the mini version, and the fries are generous but McMenamin's happy hour cheeseburger and fresh cut fries kicks the crap out of Five Guys and is cheaper to boot.  I am not a big fast food person, but was craving a fast burger last night and I wanted to say how awesome this place was.  The three employees working were AMAZING!  I am eating gluten free and asked for my burger with a lettuce wrap rather then a bun.  They inquired if I had an allergy and made special care to change their gloves when making the burger.  I was very impressed.  They have a great variety of toppings for your burger too.  I really wanted to say how great the employees working were though-SUPER friendly!  Fries and grilled cheese were burnt. Half the fries were inedible. Staff asked us to return the fries and were less than accommodating. Have ate at many five guys and this one was very disappointing  I know it\'s "just Five Guys" but I LOVE this location! Really, the owner of this location should be very proud of his staff here. Every single member of the staff is not just nice but they always genuinely seem excited to be there talking to you.  The place is always super clean and with the view of the city while eating outside- you can not beat it! I say this after numerous visits (my office is right across the street at Picnic Table Productions so I am here at least 3x a month)  I really LOVE Five Guys!!!\r\n\r\nFreshly prepared food, customized any way you want it AND ridiculous portions...sign me up!\r\n\r\nI walked in and the staff was super helpful and very polite! I ordered a hot dog with a side of little fries. And don\'t let the wording fool you...a "little" is more than enough for a filling meal. \r\n\r\nOne of the things I love most about this place is that they use FRESH jalape\xc3\xb1os!! That really adds the perfect amount of heat to your meal.  And I agree with Tonya P, load up your hotdog with the jalape\xc3\xb1os, onions and mustard and you have a real winner!!!! I also really enjoy the fries, they are seasoned well and are always dropped fresh so they are piping hot. \r\n\r\nMmmmm...Mmmmmm....Very good!!! Can\'t wait to come back!  If you don\'t like Five Guys, you don\'t like hamburgers.\r\n\r\nThis is by far my favorite burger joint of all time.   I order a "Little Cheeseburger" with raw onions, pickles, and ketchup, and then I eat it while crying tears of joy.  Five Guys makes a good burger and serves up heaping orders of freshly made fries. So I was happy to see the new South Boulevard location open recently. \r\n\r\nThe menu is pretty simple. If you\'re looking for a normal-sized burger, you\'ll want to get the "little" burger or cheeseburger. The regular one comes with two patties and, well, it\'s a lot of beef. The fries are just perfect. Perfect crispiness, perfect seasoning, so very greasy. \r\n\r\nFive Guys is good for takeout, though you\'ll have to wait a couple minutes for your food since it\'s made to order. You can also call ahead.  In my last several visits, Five guys has been great and I've had no complaints but tonight is a different story.  The tomatoes on my burger were green in the middle and hard and crunchy.  The burger, after 4 hours, is still just sitting in my stomach like a rock.  And the fries that are normally great, were limp and unsalted.  \r\n\r\nAlso i accidentally filled my cup with sweet tea and topped it off with the unsweet instead of the other way around.  Man that was pure sugar.  How do people drink sweet tea like that?  They should really call it Sugar water with tea color.  Ugh.\r\n\r\nNo it's not going to stop me from going back because during the week they seem to be better but man, this time it hurt!  They have a great product but $7 for a hambuger, $3 for fries and $2.50 for a drink makes a very expensive lunch of nearly $14.  I will not come back as often any more.  Seems like they keep raising prices to where they are too high!!!  low key, fresh taste, good fries.  like the peanuts while wating  I was craving a decent burger for quite some time and I thought while I was NC, what the heck. Burgers are made to order and appear to be hand made. The rolls are fresh and all the fixins you could want on a hamburger are there. The fries are hand cut are pretty decent if you can get them while they are hot...and there is a lot of em! If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be going back.  I gave this two starts on the strength of the fries ONLY.  Fresh cut, fresh cooked, and plenty of 'em.  Nice.\r\n\r\nBurger?  Not so much.  In fact, not one little bit.  I think what lost me was the cheese.  Tasted like a melted Wham-O Superball.  Totally, totally fake pasteurized process cheese food.  Blech.\r\n\r\nAlso, the burger seemed to be completely unseasoned.  Needs... something.  Worcestershire?  Tabasco?  Garlic?  All Three?  And REAL cheese pleeez.\r\n\r\nAlso, Regular burger, fries, coke = $11.  WHAT!  The Miller High Life Delivery Guy won't be loving them either!  Let's get the best thing about Five Guys out of the way, they serve fresh cut french fries so hot, you can't even touch them.  That alone is worth the trip.  I have my own french fry ritual there,  I like to toss my fries in the brown bag that they come in,add pepper and shake them up, then roll the bag down for easy access..   \r\nFive Guys burgers are basic build your own burger, freshly cooked, topped with your favorite toppings and wrapped in foil.  On their menu, they have bread & butter pickles and  fresh jalapeno (not pickled).  Anytime I eat an expensive hamburger, I always think I would rather spend half the money and go to Five Guys.  If they only served booze, I would never want to leave.  I will rate Five Guys four honey buns.  I was about to forget, I LOVE their hot dogs, raw onion, mustard and jalapenos.  Dare I say, it might be better than the burger?  Went in for a quick 6:30 am coffee before a meeting. Employee was rude, coffee had something in it, toilet was backed up, air hand dryer broken.  It\'s just like all the other Second Cups, really, except this one hadn\'t run out of their apple cider mix. \r\n\r\nSecond Cup apple cider is probably the best of the chain apple ciders, and a friend of mine living in Hong Kong recently put out a plea on Facebook for apple cider. Hence, my search. \r\n\r\nAll the specialty shops were sold out (duh, it\'s CHRISTMAS) and so I thought, "Second Cup?" and I tried a few but this was the only one who had any regular apple cider left (not cranberry-cider). \r\n\r\nSo kudos for that.  This Second Cup is under new ownership and the staff are super friendly and helpful! It is a very welcoming place. They have a fantastic back patio where you can sit and work and enjoy the sunshine. The matcha green tea frappe they make is by far my favourite drink there! Must try! Will definitely be back as my go to place!  Looks a bit run down. I came in looking to redeem some points for coffee beans but they were having issues with the system so I left empty handed.\r\n\r\nThe person behind the counter was nice but not very knowledgeable and looked a bit overwhelmed even though there was only 3 people in the place.\r\n\r\nI would not come back here again.  I really like this location, especially in the summer when their patio is open! It's not very busy most of the time - at least, I've never had any trouble getting a seat. \r\n\r\nMy only issue, and it's really a non-issue, is the staff. Most of them are nice enough, but no one really engages with the customers. One staff I see regularly seems downright annoyed at having to serve customers. On the whole it doesn't bother me too much, but it is something I've noticed. \r\n\r\nOverall, it's a great stop if you're in Bloor West Village and want something familiar. Definitely come by in the summer and check out the patio!  Coffee shop with a quiet small back yard. Coffee is strong, and there is a good selection of pastries. They have lactose-free milk among their milk options and gluten free baked goods. Fast and friendly service...  It\'s Saturday morning, and I need to kill some time and use a toilet. Why not go to the coffee shop and drink a latte on the John? Second cup is the nearest; thank you Yelp. I walk in and I\'m struck by the cramped atmosphere. The place is very small. The staff have sour attitudes. The cashier didn\'t really comprehend English (she said "what it means?" (sic) as a reply to my order). The barista leaves my order on the counter and barely musters to announce that it is ready, and avoids eye contact when I pick it up and say thank you. I go to the men\'s room to have a leisurely sit down. I find the bathroom equally cramped. Old industrial \'round\' doorknobs (not handles) with sticky surfaces. There is no hook in the bathroom to hang my jacket. I try to hang my jacket from the loose screw sticking out of the door-closer bracket, which is not attached to the door. The jacket wont stay put. I take a sip of my coffee and hate it. Feeling the \'last straw\' I leave the bathroom, abandon my coffee at the counter and go down the street to a different coffee shop (rhymes with Bar Tux) where I get the opposite experience. The barista is upbeat and understands my order. He asks how I\'m doing. He offers food samples. He makes conversation. I go to the bathroom to attend to bodily needs and find the bathroom large, in good repair, and yes there is a coat hook. My Saturday morning is saved. In summary: Second Cup needs to get this location cleaned up to today\'s cleanliness and customer service standards.  Saturday night.\r\nDate night.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s try somewhere new," I suggest to my man... and alas, he agrees!\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, we find ourselves sitting in Little Rangoon.  We\'re the only ones in the place aside from the staff.  We probably would\'ve left had it not been for the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on the door and Alfred, the friendly owner who was also our waiter...\r\n\r\nJared not only agreed to go somewhere new but he allowed me to do the ordering.  The first dish that caught my eye was some sort of vegetarian dish that Alfred said people either love it or hate it.  He wasn\'t trying too hard to sell it, so we went with some more common (at least to us) choices from the menu:  spring rolls (the kind that are not fried) with chicken, a noodle dish similar to a pad seu eu, and a vegetable dish with tofu that we added okra to.  (I love okra!)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the chicken in the spring rolls was rubbery and kind of gross... and the vegetable dish was covered in a really oily sauce that lacked flavor.  I\'d probably give this place two stars, but Alfred was nice enough and they serve okra - huge props for that.  Even so, the meal was pricey for what we had... and I don\'t think I\'ll be returning anytime soon.  I hope it was an off night for their sake.  \r\n\r\nAnd now, because of our so-so \\/ not fantastic experience, I am pretty sure I will not be allowed to choose the date night restaurant for a while... :(  So, you\'ve never had Burmese food before?\r\nI hadn\'t, either -- until going to Little Rangoon this weekend. \r\n\r\n According to the menu, "Burma shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand, and so its cuisine is invariably influenced by these surrounding cultural spices, seasonings, ingredients and cooking styles."\r\nAnd yet, it was completely different from anything I\'d had before, too.  \r\n\r\nLittle Rangoon has a lovely atmosphere. It\'s one of those restaurants that has nice decorations and a romantic feel to it -- like an expensive restaurant would -- but still manages to price its entrees between $8-16. This place is definitely not a hole-in-the-wall -- it\'s pretty, with nice art on the walls.\r\nFor starters, my husband ordered the chicken curry pastry puffs, which were really good, he said.\r\nFor entrees, I decided to try something called "samosas and Ba-Yar Gyaw Soup," which is a tasty thick yellow bean soup with cabbage, onion, potato and tamarind juice. It\'s presented with broken up pieces of samosa and Ba-Yar-Gyaw (dried split peas crushed and deep fried). It was $8 and it was SO AWESOME. If I could have this for lunch everyday, I would. The owner told us that particular soup is really popular among the women who come in for their lunch breaks.\r\n\r\nMy husband, meanwhile, ordered the coconut milk chicken curry, which he loved. He said it had high-quality ingredients, and the taste was more subtle than a Thai or Indian curry would be.\r\nFor dessert, I ordered Burmese semolina cake, which was nice, but heavy. \r\nHe ordered Falooda, which is this funky rose-flavored milk, icecream, tapioca, bread pudding and jello strips all mixed into a sundae dish (It\'s quite the acquired taste -- although I like it).\r\nThroughout dinner, the owner was very friendly about discussing Burmese cooking, etc. The waitresses were friendly, too.\r\nI really hope this place makes it -- it\'s tucked in the same complex as a Claim Jumper, Tapino and Radda wine bars and Sushi on Shea, so it has a lot of competition for diners. But in my opinion, it\'s the best on the block!  Stuffed ourselves with great authentic Burmese food for less than $12 per person!\r\n\r\nThanks to all the fellow yelpers for pointing us to Little Rangoon during our visit to Scottdale. In trying to find good eats outside our resort hotel in Paradise Valley, we found this little gem in a strip mall, with a friendly owner, great food and service, for our large party of 9. \r\n\r\nWe had chicken skewers for the kids, Tobu Salad (homemade Burmese style tofu from yellow soy beans), Talapia Curry, Chicken Kebob (marinated and stir-fried with jalapenos), Malaysian Rice Noodles, Baby Bok Choy and Shitake Mushrooms which were all excellent.  Two of us in our party had actually visited Burma and lived in Thailand, and thought the food was authentically Burmese.\r\n\r\nThe decor and ambience was warm and inviting. Alfred the owner chatted with us for quite a while as he and his wife were both from the SF Bay area like ourselves.  The wait staff was attentive and quick with our order.\r\n\r\nWe got a whopping 30% off our order, so the check came to about $12 per person -- really great value for the quality of food.\r\n\r\nWe so want this mom-and-pop business to survive in this economy, so we're yelping about their great food and service, and hope if you are in the Scottsdale area, you'll try it and enjoy it as much as we did!  Wonderful ethnic food! Went early for dinner and got the 'early bird special' (offered 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. for $9.99), which comes with salad, entree, and dessert. Salad was a delicious room temperature noodle salad with really interesting flavor combinations. For entree I chose the pork belly curry which was served on a larger plate---curry in a bowl, mound of rice and small tomato and cucumber salad on the plate. Pork was worderful, well-seasoned, and a bit spicy (ordered as 3 out of 4 on the spice scale). Dessert was a mango pudding which was much more like a creme brulee in texture. And it wasn't overly sweet like some mango dishes. Had a hint of cinnamon, I think, and a dollop of something like whip cream on top. Also ordered an add-on soup for an extra $2, and it was good as well. A catfish, noodle soup which was very creamy in texture, either from pureeing or from long cooking time. In any case, it was delicious as well. All in all a great dining experience for really cheap. Would definitely recommend!  Stumbled into Little Rangoon while looking for a parking spot for another restaurant and decided as we had never experienced Burmese cuisine before that we would try this place, mind you we love Gujarati, South Indian, Korean, Thai, Szechuan, and Hunan cooking. We stayed away from the menu items that are obviously there to satisfy the less adventurous and aimed at what we thought were the more traditional Burmese dishes. Our meal started with us sharing the Green Tea Salad - which to this day, even after eating this awesome dish dozens of times, is still a favorite. The marinated green tea, crunchy garlic slices, crunchy yellow peas, peanuts, and smoked dried shrimp are all hand carried by friends and family out of Burma. These are added to thin sliced cabbage, tomato, some lemon, oil, and - if you request it, boiled egg. So while this dish may appear pricey, considering its origins and the rarity of these ingredients in the United States, we are quite lucky to be able to sample this delicacy. Try Green Tea Salad with a side of rice for a complete meal.\r\n\r\nMy wife asked for the Spinach and Marinated Bamboo Shoots for her entree and was asked if she knew if that was what she really wanted as this is typically an acquired taste. The smell of the marinated bamboo shoots is not for everyone, but my wife is never one to shy away from a food challenge, she loved it and has ordered it a couple of times since then. I ordered the Pork Belly Curry served in a homemade tomato based savory curry I have enjoyed ever since (this curry is used as a base for many of the curry dishes). For dessert it was our lucky day as Elizabeth, the owner, had made her and her workers a special Sanwin Makin or semolina cake with durian (normally it is made with raisins) - delicious, but an acquired taste for us Americans. This must be the easiest way to try durian for the first time as its notorious smell is hard to detect in the cake, not that this was our first time experiencing this pungent king of fruits.\r\n\r\nOn subsequent visits we have been treated to most every Burmese dish on the menu, including a number of items not on the menu. One of my personal favorites which they have on offer from time to time is the Butternut Squash and Fish Curry. Another favorite but not for the weak of palate due to its astronomic spice levels is a simple preparation of sliced onion with salt, oil, lemon, and enough roasted chilie flakes to camouflage the onions. It sounds simple but the combination comes together to deliver something awesome - this spicy onion salad is more typically a food eaten by rural Burmese. The Pig Ear Salad (not on the menu) was challenging but we were both thrilled at the opportunity to try it. \r\n\r\nSomething you must try is the Tobu Salad, and no, this is not a spelling mistake, I did not mean tofu. Tobu is a yellow split pea based kind of tofu that is sliced and mixed into a large salad which is one of my wife's and my favorite dishes here. She also loves the Moh Hinga. This soup is one of the most traditional of all Burmese dishes. Moh Hinga is made of cat fish and rice noodles, garnished with cilantro, and on request served with sides of lemon juice, chili flakes, boiled egg, and crunchy yellow peas which you can mix into the soup to your own taste. There are many more authentic Burmese dishes on the menu but if you only try what might already be familiar to you, you will not have mustered the courage to try something new and wonderful.\r\n\r\nLittle Rangoon, like nearly all restaurants in the Phoenix \\/ Scottsdale area this year finds themselves at times in the doldrums waiting for a customer but they are surviving so if you find the restaurant devoid of diners don't let that disuade you from dipping your toe into the Taste of Burma. One more thing, the FALOODA. Oh My God, the falooda for dessert: vanilla ice-cream, egg custard, boba (tapioca pearls), thin agar noodles, and rose syrup milk is a treat that only a fool would pass up. I live for Falooda.  I never realized there were other restaurants behind Claim Jumper on Shea until Alex C. told me about Little Rangoon.  And what a find it is!  The restaurant opened early this year taking over an Italian restaurant with Roman pillars and the works.  The owners added artwork brought over from Asia to make it their own - the East meets West look is really quite elegant. \r\n\r\nAlfred the owner manages the front of house and his Burmese wife is in charge of the kitchen.  The couple\'s love and pride for what they do shows in every aspect from decor to service to food.  As a fellow small business owner I can really appreciate that.\r\n\r\nWe followed Alfred\'s recommendations and ordered the "more" Burmese dishes (vs other dishes with greater influence from bordering countries like Thailand and India).  We\'re glad we did because starting with the Tea Leaf Salad, we had a chance to taste things that we\'ve never experienced before even after living many years in Bangkok.  \r\n\r\nExcellent food and service at a great value - we\'ll definitely be back.  First impressions, I was thinking Burmese food was going to be just like Thai food after first glance at the menu. But I was wrong! \r\nWe ordered the Green Tea leaf salad for starters.....don\'t let the look of it scare you. It tasted pretty nutty to my surprise. We also had the "Tobu" salad which was the BEST tofu I have ever had. They don\'t use Chinese tofu, they use their own Burmese style tofu which was creamy and soooo tasty. I don\'t know if it was the slightly spicy sauce they used but it was fantastic. I could eat that "salad" (no lettuce in this salad) everyday!\r\nMy entree was the curry with halibut, which I ordered with the coconut rice. The halibut was cooked perfectly but I ordered the mild curry and I could of gone hotter, so I thought it lacked a little flavor from what I am used to in curries. The coconut rice was worth despite the added calories. Everyone else ordered meat dishes so I didn\'t get a chance to try them but  they seemed to love them and couldn\'t stop talking about how flavorful it all was. \r\nI will defiantly be back to "Burma" when I am craving tofu...which could be everyday! \r\nThis place is closed on Mondays........  Little Rangoon features novel cuisine, well executed dishes and quite reasonable prices (thx to the 30% discount) . Seven of us shared a unique family style dinner in a pleasant atmosphere, for under $100 before tip. \r\n\r\nWe liked all four curries, but agreed the fish and pork belly were best, while beef and chicken seemed more an accomodation to western tastes. I normally dismiss tilapia as a cheap bland whitefish, but it's a knockout with the curry.  Everyone liked the Tobu salad, and Tea Leaf salad got raves from my wife, who's not a particularly adventurous eater. Deep fried opa squash has a flaky texture, like swordfish, and was also quite good. \r\n\r\nWhat stands between Little Rangoon and five stars?  An owner waited on us, which has its charms, but he was also kinda tone deaf in terms of certain aspects of table service.  Portions arent big, and passing the shared plates around there was more a feeling of rationing than of plenty.  Nobody starved, of course, but a better server could've handled that and some other little things better. Not a huge deal. \r\n\r\nOverall, we had a very positive experience, and recommend this place if you're seeking something different, arent in a hurry and dont want to break the bank. Dont let the hidden location or lack of customers discourage you.  The food really is quite good, with a handful of intriguing dishes, and worth the trip.  Been meaning to try this place for a while and swung by for lunch while running some errands.  Delish.  I won't write a whole review as I've only been once and had a lunch special.  The menu seems to be very pan-Asian influenced, with bold flavors.  If you like heat, ask for the side chile sauces, which you can mix in and increase to your desired level of pow.  The owners were incredibly nice and I'm afraid their lease is up, so it remains to be seen if they stay put.  If you like Asian food, give them some business... I think it would be a great place to take friends and share a bunch of dishes.  Food is fantastic.  Spice levels are appropriate. Great selection of beer and wine.  Our favorite dish was the tobu salad; it's light, zesty and refreshing.  Tobu is Burmese tofu made of another bean instead of soy.  The Ba-Yar Gyaw appetizer was also very good. The semolina cake for dessert is tasty. My only complaint is that we didn't bring enough people to justify ordering more dishes.  Rereading my post, I\'m aware that my review may sound to be a negative one, but I want to make it clear that I did enjoy the flavors of the dishes I tried.  It was the less-than warm reception to the questions I had asked- a perception I haven\'t had in a VERY long time (all the venues I\'ve been to for many months, a few years, even, have been quite accomodating), and the long wait times I encountered affected the tone of this review.  \r\n---\r\nI\'ve had this "Taste of Phoenix" giftcard (purchased through Costco) good at restaurants such as Tapino, Picazzo Gourmet Pizza, Medizona, and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas, so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday.  Alfred, who I later found out is one of the venue\'s two owners (found a business card w\\/ his name on it), showed me to one of the corner tables (there were two occupied tables indoors and a full table outdoors).  \r\n\r\nAfter food allergy issues were covered, I ordered the two items I spotted on the online menu beforehand- Chicken satay app and Dhal curry.  I was starving and was thankful for the complimentary fried wontons and questionary dipping sauce.  It looked somewhat akin to Chinese duck sauce and was sure to contain allergenic ingredients (Alfred didn\'t check on the info).  Though I was almost starving, I had to ask Alfred to take the plate away, even though 2\\/3 of the wonton chips remained.  Thankfully, the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously, albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup (15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand, but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4"x1" skewers of grilled chicken skewers?).  Though it wasn\'t as dark in the restaurant as my photos would lead you to believe, the somewhat fatty satay skewers didn\'t have that gorgeous caramelization I\'m used to seeing in other venues and as such did not strike me as "grilled to perfection" as stated on the menu.  The serving temperature of the skewers also seemed closer to room temperature than straight from the grill, but at least I was able to eat these right away since the Dhal curry was so hot, I had to let it cool for at least ten minutes.  The paratha that accompanied the curry was nicely plump and flaky when it first arrived, and, fortunate for me, I tore a piece and tried it with the too-hot curry then and so was able to enjoy its flakiness.  After devouring the slightly luke-warm satay skewers, which were very good when paired with the DELICIOUS peanut sauce (although I found it visually off-putting), I turned my attention to the curry soup, which was still very hot, but was so tasty that I decided to plow ahead (an almost visual truth since I was hungry!).  The split pea and lentil soup was a satisfying meal, yet I was expecting a more viscous consistency, closer to hummus, although I cannot fathom why, since dhal\\/daal curries of Indian cuisine are also on the watery side (at least Pasand\'s and Udupi Cafe\'s were, as I recall).  The cooled paratha was disappointing at this point since the flakiness was almost nonexistent, and the bread\'s texture was now almost pasty.  Should I order the dhal curry dish again, I\'ll have to ask that the paratha be brought out after the soup\'s cooled for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nI hope to visit soon for lunch where I hope I\'ll be able to give a higher rating.  In the meantime, please enjoy the pics I\'ve included!  :)  Be warned- it took at least fifteen minutes for my check to arrive, despite the fact there were only three or four tables occupied at any given time (around ten people or under that).  Thought I\'d also mention that while the take-out menu only indicated two dessert items (Sanwin Makin and Mango-coconut pudding), the server did show me a menu with many intriguing gelato desserts ranging from $3 scoops to $5-$8 sundaes and other creations!  Since I had the impression that Alfred didn\'t appreciate the food allergy questions I posed to him earlier, I wasn\'t in the mood to go into more detail with the gelatos\' ingredients.  \'Twas a shame, since my sweet tooth was raging after having consumed the spicy curry soup.  So imagine if you threw Indian, Chinese, and Thai food into a blender. Grossed out? Intrigued? Skeptical? Well, that\'s Burmese food for you.\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard about Little Rangoon opening in the Valley some months ago, my immediate thought was "I need to head over there right now and devour some Beef Kebat stat!" As one who used to be a fervent patron of the much-debated-on-Yelp Burma Superstar and Mandalay back in San Francisco (I fully disclose I just dropped the SF bomb), I was really missing the unique blend of flavors that Burmese food was all about. I\'ll be honest and say I was completely surprised that a Burmese restaurant actually opened here, but then again I\'ve been to Uzbek, Iraqi and Bosnian restaurants in Phoenix so I really shouldn\'t be. I\'m not complaining, in any case.\r\n\r\nAll that ramble said, work had other ideas for the past several months and I never had the time to go to Little Rangoon until last week with some friends of mine who really know their southeast Asian food. \r\n\r\nThe setting is nice - albeit it looks like it used to be a fancy Italian restaurant or something once upon a time, with its roman columns and whatnot. The music selection was awesome, though. Imagine ChungKing Express, but not. I think we heard "She\'s Like The Wind" in Burmese. I am not kidding you. \r\n\r\nWe started off with two appetizers - the samosas and the crispy gourd (opo) fritters. None of us thought the samosas were that flavorful (even with the acknowledgment that they wouldn\'t be like Indian samosas), but we took a liking to the fried opo. Light and tasty, not too greasy, with a zesty dipping sauce. \r\n\r\nNext came our entrees - a noodle dish and two curries. We were all looking forward to the Pan Tay Kauswer (egg noodles in chicken coconut curry), but the dish was kind of a let down in the flavor department. Edible, for sure, but none of us sang its praises. The two other dishes (the Traditional Chicken Curry and the Boneless Beef Shortrib Curry) were much better and had a lot of flavor - both veer somewhat towards to the Indian side of spice spectrum and I\'d definitely recommend them. You could say they cook these flavors better than most of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. \r\n\r\nI really wanted to end the meal with some falooda (rose-flavored milk with tapioca pearls and agar jelly strips) for dessert, but we were all about to burst so I held back. \r\n\r\nAll in all, my friends and I were pretty pleased with the meal, the service, and the overall experience (I mean, come on, Burmese Patrick Swayze?) and I\'d give it 3.75 stars overall, rounding up to 4. Crowd was pretty light on this weeknight and I am hoping it picks up more business as a lot of people probably stick to their tried and true Chinese, Thai, and sushi restaurants. You can tell they\'re a little worried because they started adding dishes to its menu that obviously cater to risk-averse diners (chicken with orange sauce, I\'m looking at you), but I\'m hoping folks who go here experience what is traditionally Burmese. I plan on going back myself to get the Tea Leaf Salad, gold potato curry with paratha, and that elusive falooda (there\'s only so much one can devour in one sitting).\r\n\r\nHopefully I\'ll see you there.  I've been to Little Rangoon twice and I haven't been disappointed. I always try to stick to the more obscure and Burmese dishes and they have always been an exotic and unique blend of flavors. Here is what I suggest to newbies deciding to dine there!\r\n\r\nAppetizers: The Fried Opo is the must off the list... it's a sort of gourd that's tempura battered and fried into yumminess! Oh, and the mussels are quite tasty, too!\r\nSalads: Heavenly Tomato Salad... and it is heavenly! If you are daring, try the Tea Salad... It's got a lot of spices and just didn't impress me to ever get it again. but that's just my taste buds... Must say it was very interesting!\r\nNoodles: Still haven't found a favorite... I think the closest to it would be the Malaysian noodles.\r\nEntrees: Beef Curry Short Ribs, Little Rangoon Curry with Tilapia\r\nSides: Paratha... sooooo thin and melt in your mouth yummy! Great with Dipping sauce!\r\nDessert: Sanwin Makin (Semolina Cake with White Poppyseeds) and the Cappucino Crunch Gelato or the Tartufo--very hazulnut chocolatey!\r\n\r\nI made reservations both times and they have accomodated me nicely... the only sad thing was that they didn't have the Sanwin Makin dessert the last time I was there... going again soon, so hopefully that won't be the case as I find myself craving it whenever I'm in a food nostalgic sort of mood.\r\n\r\nThey are currently running crazy ridiculous lunch specials and 30% all menu items so there's not better time to try it but now!\r\n\r\nWait service has always been attentive and helpful... I think I had the same waitress everytime and she was helpful in figuring out how many dishes to serve a party of six and which dishes she would recommend.\r\n\r\nAmbiance is a dimly world that with the artwork tries to transport you to Burma, but on an architectural note takes you elsewhere... say Greece or maybe Italy... probably figments of the restaurant that preceeded Rangoon... in any case more upscale than your usual Asian restaurant, which is nice.\r\n\r\nSo Little Rangoon, I hope you're here to stay because where else but burma would I turn to to get my Burmese fix?!  first time having burmese food.  i was quite surprised.  it is supposed to be influenced mostly by indian, thai and chinese cuisine.  i would say it was stronger of thai overall.  we got the garlic noodles (chinese style), curry prawns (thai style) and for dessert it was some kind of indian ice cream thing (really, really good) and a good 'ole fashion traditional burmese cake (sort of like bread pudding).  everything was quite good, especially the curry prawns.  they were absolutely perfect with some thai level of heat.  Felt like a trip to Burma - a little like Thailand, a little like India, but it's own special place.  The ginger salad, like the green tea salad, was phenomenal - lots of flavor and crunch.  The tilapia curry was great.  And the service was excellent - lots of guidance with the menu and our water glasses were never empty.  Th And a discount in January made the bill very reasonable!  What a find.  Sure we didn't live 1000 miles away.  Never had Burmese food before...dammit...now I'm craving it all the time after Little Rangoon.  The Tea Leaf salad was unique, unique, unique.  I really would stick to the Burmese food here even though they represent Vietmanese and Indian.  It's rich, spicy and unusual...and cheap.  Alfred and his staff were very genuine and friendly.  Might not make it back, but will look for Burmese in Chicago.  Popped in for a late lunch Saturday. \r\n\r\nI like almost everything about this place, except possibly the location, which prevents most of us from finding it. (next to "Sushi on Shea"). First off they offer an extensive wine list, the place is well decorated, and certainly worthy of a budget date night. Anyway, the food was great as was the service. I recommend you give this place a try and specifically request the Burmese dishes.  Great food. I've done Burmese before and while I'm not intimately familiar with Burmese food, Little Rangoon didn't seem as authentic as other experiences I've had. I really think they should try to put more authentic Burmese dishes on the menu.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found the food really tasty, well prepared and unique. Service was good and they have a nice selection of Asian beers (bottled). Definitely recommend the place. Good stuff.  Although I've never had Burmese food before, I suspect that this isn't particularly good Burmese food.  We had the lamb curry and the pork belly curry.  The lamb curry was palatable but wasn't spiced strongly enough.  The pork belly curry was also good, but it was a bit too sweet for our liking (and we love sweet thai curries).   Also, we were asked how spicy we wanted them, and we both requested very spicy, but the dishes came out very bland.  \r\n\r\nAfter this restaurant I would definitely try a different Burmese restaurant, but I don't think I'd go back here.  The curry is similar enough to Indian that we'd rather go to Indian Paradise on Hayden when we are in the mood for this type of food.  I went to Little Rangoon based on Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed. I love curry and we tried the coconut curry (with chicken instead of shrimp) and the pork belly curry. I was playing it safe with the coconut curry, it was made with very tender dark meat which was delicious, but the pork belly curry was unique and awesome too. We tried the ginger salad, which wasn't the normal lettuce salad. I think it was made with dried ginger slices, dried split peas, cabbage, sauce, hard boiled egg, yellow pea flour, and some other things I can't remember. It was definitely different and refreshing. Also had the fried Opo (squash) which is like vegetable tempura. It was good too, and I would guess the sauce house made. Service was great, the owner was walking around making sure everyone was happy. It's not a fancy place, but nice. I did get the impression that the owner very much cared that his guests enjoyed their meal and experience. I'd like to go back and try some items I've never had before.\r\nAlso, right now the menu is 30% off! A nice surprise!  Looking for a nicer Asian-style restaurant? Do you need a break from your standard Japanese and Thai fare? Then check out this place.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I started with the samosas, then I went with the Jumbo Prawns Coconut Curry. He went with the Jumbo Prawns Curry. Sounds like a minor distinction, I know, but the two main dishes, served family-style, tasted quite different, and he went with spice level 2 (I stuck with the still-hot-for-me level 1).\r\n\r\nThe servers were very kind and attentive.\r\n\r\nI definitely recommend it.  Pretty good... we sampled a lot of different dishes.  The sea bass was perfect, as were the noodles (Nangyi Thoke).  The spices and sauces for the dishes are unique and very flavorful.  The prices are a little higher than I thought they'd be, but then again it is a restaurant in North Scottsdale so that's probably to be expected.\r\n\r\nThey have a frequent dining card that's nice in that you get $10 off your next meal when you spend $100 total at the restaurant (doesn't have to be all at one time, it can be added up from previous visits).  Yelp to the rescue!\r\n\r\nHad to find the perfect place for a birthday dinner and the requirements where: An ethnic place that has good vegetarian\\/seafood options that they had never been to before...and it would be a plus if the place was good. \r\n\r\nAn almost impossible task was Ahead of me. The clock was ticking, with 8 hours left I started by asking every stranger at the coffee bean I was at for help. the best option I got from those conversations was a steak house!,either ethnic nor vegetarian... Defeated I turned to Yelp...\r\n\r\nFirst Yelp helped me remember all the places I\'ve been to with this person so I knew where to rule out. Next I did place a post on the Talk section asking for help, and got some good Mexican choices, but I was looking for more middle eastern or African.\r\n\r\nI started clicking away on every cuisine in yelp, allot of which Phoenix doesn\'t even have. Cambodian, Moroccan, Afghan I went through them all and made a list of 5...and Little Rangoon was the only one they hadn\'t been too. \r\n\r\nA little hard to find behind the Claim jumper I had to call in to find my way through the shopping center its in. Inside really nice decor that is a mix between Greek pillars and little Burmese Accents.\r\n\r\nOur dinner guests all wondered about where is Burma? The menu had a nice little thing about it being between India and Thailand... and that\'s what the food reminded me of similar, but yet completely unique all on its own. Fried squash "Opo" a traditional Burmese snack was a great Appetizer. Had the traditional fish Curry dish and the sea bass with Black bean sauce with Cilantro on top. I have always been a fan of adding Cilantro to my stir-fry, Great to see it used here...(side note some people feel Cilantro tastes like soap and If you see me in person I have an embarrassing Exploding Cilantro story to tell. It involves a Garbage disposal and a "I told you so" moment) \r\n\r\nFor desert had "fooloda" an interesting yogurt shake type thing that I wouldn\'t recommend... the traditional "Sanwin Makin" cake was very good... but the crispy banana fritters topped with ice cream was unbelievable.... no really I can\'t believe that that was bananas. I actually think that they gave us a different dessert. A mistake that it fell on our table on its way back to heaven. It was that good...\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed, many conversations where started about the cool new cuisine that everyone tried. "Yelp, whats that?" is often the first question asked about the story ... Oh its just the coolest thing that saved the day...\r\n\r\nLittle Rangoon 5 Stars...\r\nYelp... more stars then I can count....  I was surprised to find a Burmese restaurant in Scottsdale while on a business trip.  I had one great experience with Burmese cuisine in Washington, so I gave it a try.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant was tucked away in a strip mall surrounded by other larger restaurants.  Given the location I was assuming a bare-bone restaurant, but was surprise to find the restaurant decorated nicely with what seemed to be authentic Burmese arts and crafts.\r\n\r\nI had the special tofu salad, which was made with Burmese tofu made of chickpeas instead of standard soy.  The tofu had a mildly sweet taste which was balanced well with the spicy sauce.\r\n\r\nFor the entree, I had the chick curry, which was spicy but not overwhelming that I could not enjoy the taste of the spices.  \r\n\r\nIn general, a great experience and food.  My only regret is the 3,000 mile distance between myself and the restaurant.  While rethinking a trip I took to Myanmar a few years back, I really don\'t remember eating anything typically Burmese. Just chicken, rice and fish really. After eating here, it made me want to go back and see what I missed.\r\n\r\nI came by here last night on a whim with some family members not really knowing what to expect. Starting off, we ordered samosas which were good, but not great. For our main courses we had Beef Marsala and the Chicken Basil with jasmine rice. The portions weren\'t huge, but it was just enough to split three ways and not feel overly full. Those two dishes were made up one of the best tasting meals I\'ve had in a long time. Describing the food and the flavor is hard to do because it\'s not as hot as Thai, not as spicy as Indian, but definitely not Chinese. It\'s kind of this weird "it\'s like this, but not like that" mix which makes sense given Myanmar\'s geographical location. Regardless, it\'s some of the better tasting food I\'ve had in Scottsdale and is surprisingly well-priced. \r\n\r\nIf you\'ve ever had an ABC drink, they have a desert that\'s alot like that. I forget the name, but it was the perfect way to end the whole meal. The mango-raspberry sorbet was also ridiculously good as well.  delicious, good ambience & unique place!" 4\\/5\r\n\r\nWe had been talking about going to Little Rangoon for at least 3 months. Finally, we went there last month for J\'s birthday. When weentered the restaurant, it was only another table and us. We were quickly welcomed by the hostess and the server. Both of them were good in recommending the food to us. \r\n\r\nWe had a special tobu salad dish (made from soy paste, and veggies). Tobu salad was worth a try! It was spicy and yummy. We ordered a 3 out of 4 on its spicyness scale. We thought we could handle it! But NO! It was too spicy for us even though we are big spicy food fans. ;) \r\n\r\nWe also tried their Burmese style lamb curry and a Malaysian fried noodle. The lamb curry was good with roti pharata and steam rice! I definitely will go back for both tobu and lamb curry dish. I have a higher standard for Malaysian food since I am a Malaysian. I have to say that I wasn\'t very impressed by its Malaysian fried noodle. Maybe we should just stick to the local Burmese food next time. Price-wise... I think it is a bit above the average restaurant price but with its quality in food and service, we will definitely check back!  Branching more into unknown territories of International foods Burmese has been on my radar since reading about a wonderful place in San Francisco. So when I heard that there was a Burmese place here in the valley well, I got excited.\r\n\r\nThe place is awesome! Crossed somewhere between Asian style and Indian style we were all very surprised on how well the food is prepared. We ordered about 13 dishes with our friend (plenty of leftovers) ranging from coconut rice to beef short rib curry. The flavors were great and very unexpected in terms of simple preparation of high quality ingredients. \r\n\r\nStandouts were the ginger salad (mixed table side), pork belly curry and the coconut rice. Not only was everything just incredibly tasty but also well priced. \r\n\r\nAdd another tasty mom and pop owned restaurant to the valley.. its a real winner!  Billed as the only Burmese restaurant in Scottsdale, a claim I doubt is heavily disputed, Little Rangoon has to cater its menu to a wider audience. Though there are a few native Burmese dishes, many of the dishes were common Thai plates. Although I guess most specialized restaurants in cuisines like Burmese have to throw a wider net to catch more customers, I like to restaurants stick more to their native specialties. \r\n\r\nI did have the si gyet kauswer (garlic noodles), which is heavily Chinese inspired, but still unique enough not to be readily available at other types of restaurants. The soft egg(?) noodles were delicious, but the duck was barely present. I did enjoy the sweet sauce accompanying the noodles as well.\r\n\r\nI'll have to come back some time and order family-style so I can try more variety. I'll also be sure to try the curries, which are supposedly a cross between Indian and Thai curries.  invited by some friends with a 25 dollar off coupon, and since we love ethnic experiences, wanted to try this place out. \r\n\r\ni don\'t know what\'s wrong with my palate lately, but i keep trying these new places that i\'m not chomping at the bit or dreaming about for days afterwards. my girlfriend tells me it\'s because i\'ve crossed into the "mid-late 30\'s" and that my taste buds are just getting old....because i haven\'t given a 5 star recently, and i\'m starting to get down on myself.\r\nbut i wasn\'t that impressed with my dish. i ordered the buddha dish and it was just standard asian style veggies with 2 chunks of tofu...bok choy, carrots, peas, those cute littel corns, and a light syrupy sauce. tasted just like any other chinese food i\'ve ever had. and the dessert..semolina cake....was also just ok, not "whoa, this is delicious...i have to lick the plate" but simply ok. \r\nwe did get a toda salad which was good, and alot of the curry dishes smelled and looked tasty, so if we go back, we\'ll have to try those....\r\nbut now that we\'ver read "Eat This, Not That" restaurant edition....damn man, you can\'t eat anything in restaurant anymore without feeling guilty. i wish i\'d never read that book...boo hoo. \r\n\r\nso to sum up, if you get something, go for hearty...a curry or meat dish, they may be better than what we got. and get dessert somewhere else. oh....our waitress said the family style plates we were ordereing were big enough for two people, but i didn\'t think they were (and i\'m little....only 145 and i ate my whole plate plus dessert). \r\n\r\nexcellent staff...very friendly. we spent about 25 bucks each there.  Apparently Motherhome makes Burmese Cuisine.\r\nApparently they have an intriguing Menu.\r\nApparently my Friend was SUPER anxious to try that Menu.\r\nApparently this Friend took me there for Lunch.\r\nApparently this Friend didn\'t do her research.\r\nApparently....\r\n\r\nLunch at Motherhome is pre-cooked Lunch counter specials.\r\nFor what we had, it was just another regular fill-d-stomach Meal.  2.5\'d\r\nOwner was friendly almost gave us Steam Rice overdose, we kindly denied.\r\n\r\nSpicy Curry Goat with Rice ($5.99)\r\nFish in Tomato Sauce ($7.99)\r\n\r\nApparently "someone" needs more thorough research for her future Trips.\r\nLet\'s learn from our experiences shall we?  Motherhome seems so out of place in the Bloordale Neighbourhood with it's purple storefront and the food they are serving! The interior is surprising clean, bright and modern. \r\n\r\nThe set up is more a food court style with hot food already cooked and heating under heat lamp. \r\n\r\nPrices are reasonable with a full meal of carb, protein and veggie for $5 taxes in for takeout. In order to eat in, there is a $1 surcharges which we gladly paid. \r\n\r\nSpicy Curry Goat with Rice ($5.99) has a nice kick of spice and the meat were quite tender and well flavoured. \r\n\r\nFish in Tomato Sauce ($7.99) was a little disappointing. Maybe because I ate that along side with the curry, I found the sauce was bland. The fish has a lot of sharp little bones inside and it was a little overcooked and dry. \r\n\r\nMotherhome also has store made sauces\\/paste and desserts on sale. I might have to try some of the dessert next time! \r\n\r\nThe owner that serves us was really polite and friendly, even with all the questions I ask and all the silly request I had!! \r\n\r\nThey accepts all credit cards!  This restaurant offers great value for money.  This is good honest food at a very reasonable price.  Could be less greasy though.  Really enjoyed the food here! The staff was really friendly, not sure if he was the owner or not. Recommended to us authentic Burmese food. The best was the fermented tea leaf salad. Really unique, refreshing, and had a nice crunch to it! I would definitely go back for more of this. The fish soup was amazing too. It has noodles inside and comes with different types of toppings you can put on like green onions, parsley, chili flakes etc. The curry was average, nothing special. And the spring rolls was average as well. But the hot sauce that comes with the spring rolls for dipping was divine. \r\n\r\nAs for the place itself, it was quite clean. You definitely won't classify it as high class, but you'd feel comfortable sitting inside and each table came with a toronto star and toronto life magazines. Alot of people came in and out for takeout from the counter, and several tables had people eating off the menu.
